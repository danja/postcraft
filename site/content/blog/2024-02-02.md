# Groundhog Day with Community Solid Server

> Today is Groundhog Day. The groundhog did not see his shadow, so spring is coming early.

Like the film, I'm repeating things I've done before, with minor changes in the hope ~~of getting the girl~~ things work better this time. Currently installing [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer) on my server (virtual, hosted by linode.com, running Ubuntu). I mostly want it for auth for other services, but it's a good excuse to have a play.

I've tried Solid at least twice before, once when it was first announced, and again when I was having a nosey a year or two ago. First time there wasn't much to see, second time I couldn't get it going after an hour or so, gave up. This time, **it appears to have worked!**

Had a little bit of pratting around, but in short I ssh'd into the server, cloned the repo from git into a dir `/home/hkms-apps/solid`, made a dir `data` in the same dir, cd'd into `solid/CommunitySolidServer` and ran :

```
npm start -- -c ./config/file.json -f ../data
```

http://hyperdata.it:3000/ yay!

Ok, before doing anything else I'll make it start with **systemd**. I habitually go into the server over ssh as root, but I'd better make a non-privileged user for this. I will name him `solid` and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him.

```
useradd solid
...
chown -R solid:solid /home/hkms-apps/solid
```

Hmm, maybe should have been more consistent, put everything in `/home/solid/`, still, is relatively consistent with the other (inconsistent) stuff.

So, I'll make a service file,

`nano /etc/systemd/system/solid.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=Solid Community Server
Documentation=https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment=NODE_PORT=3000
Type=simple
User=solid
WorkingDirectory=/home/hkms-apps/solid/CommunitySolidServer
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start -- -c ./config/file.json -f ../data
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Ok, now,

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable solid.service
systemctl start solid.service
```

http://hyperdata.it:3000/ yay again!

_"...and I will give him security..."_ I'd better hide it behind the nginx reverse proxy I have in front of everything and get a cert for it.

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
ls
```

Ok, looking at fuseki.conf, I'll make a copy of that to solid.conf and edit it. It uses a subdomain, seems reasonable here too, `solid.hyperdata.it`.
Deleted all the certbot bits in it, changed to :

```
server {
    server_name solid.hyperdata.it;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

Will need a corresponding DNS record, so over to my DNS provider (gandi.net).
Added :

```
solid 10800 IN CNAME hyperdata.it.
```

Ok, see what certbot reckons. Oh wait, `systemctl restart nginx` first...

Fool danny, I forgot to `ln -s` the file to `sites-enabled`. Ok, now `systemctl restart nginx` agin.

> Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on https://solid.hyperdata.it

And I see it - yay!

But, docs say for a new account go to :

```
http://localhost:3000/.account/password/register/
```

Trying

```
https://solid.hyperdata.it/.account/password/register/
```

takes me to a helpful error page talking about the HTTP Header. Link to [nginx config](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/wiki/Using-NGINX-as-a-reverse-proxy), has bits I need.

Hmm. I'm not sure about the `proxy_pass` line.

Better check what certbot gave me.

```
server {
    server_name solid.hyperdata.it;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/solid.hyperdata.it/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/solid.hyperdata.it/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}

server {
    if ($host = solid.hyperdata.it) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot

    server_name solid.hyperdata.it;
    listen 80;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}

```

I'll try just adding this bit to location :

```
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host  $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # Pass these headers from the Solid server back to the client
    proxy_pass_header Server;
    proxy_pass_header Set-Cookie;

    # Enable Websocket support
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

    # Prevent ETag modification (https://github.com/solid/community-server/issues/1036)
    gzip off;
```

Nope, same error.

> The identifier https://solid.hyperdata.it/.account/password/register/ is outside the configured identifier space.

try:

```
    proxy_pass https://$host$request_uri;
```

# Your local Solid server instance

upstream community-solid-server {
server 127.0.0.1:3000;
}

listen 80;
return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# Proxy traffic for https://solid.example/ to http://localhost:3000/

    # Pass these headers from the Solid server back to the client

```

```

```

```

    server_name solid.hyperdata.it;

    location / {
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;

then the other thing mentioned in the error message, in `solid.server` :

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start -- -c ./config/file.json -f ../data --baseUrl https://solid.hyperdata.it/
```

```
systemctl stop solid.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable solid.service
systemctl start solid.service
```

https://solid.hyperdata.it/account/password/register/

now says Not Logged In.

https://solid.hyperdata.it/.account/login/password/register/

I went to

https://penny.vincenttunru.com/

and that got me to a sign up/login page

I think I'd better give myself a(another) WebID
