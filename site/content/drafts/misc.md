I was looking for any vocabs that might cover the #LLM space. Only just started when I remembered #VoID, has some obvious overlaps. So, trying a human-curated shortcut : Seen anything?

I guess it would be more DCAT

A phrase I haven't heard in a long time is 'nervous exhaustion'. When I was at the horrible school it was fairly common for a teacher to be off sick for a long period or just disappear because of it. At the time thought of it as something like influenza. It reality, the teacher had a total mental breakdown and holding conversations with garden ornaments.
now people (especially about software developers) talk about 'burnout'. But 'nervous exhaustion' does work very well for me with this thing. Only a very temporary, nowhere near the garden ornament stage. But tired in the head from information/concentration overload

Agents!

The Assistants API is awesome, had to build something...

Open-sourcing "GPTvsGPT" 🕵️🕵️
(109 lines of code)

A simple template to have two AI Assistants converse. What's exciting is the ability to extend these with retrieval, data, and custom functions.

Thank you for "All Greek to me"!! When I (too often) blab on about the tech stuff to an Italian friend Mari, she'll say "Per me è arabo" = "for me it's Arabic". I could not remember the English version.

#IBIS (Issue-Based Information System, an argumentation-based approach to clarifying problems) came to mind again, a conversation about the Middle East situation, the ultimate Wicked Problem. Only tiny differences in our views, but had we not known each other it could easily have got ugly.
It occurs to me something useful might be in easy reach.

Of course, an LLM at the heart, augmented by knowledge graphs to provide best-known facts about the topic at hand. So fewer hallucinations, more current info and with routes to provenance/trust. Yadda. But more novel: @yoheinakajima just made a demo/template getting AI Assistants conversing. So, first pass, create a chatroom, two+ humans with conflicting positions. Two+ AI agents, prompted intentionally to be biased assistants to back each human's pov. And - an agent given the role of moderator, instructed in the IBIS methodology. Let the civilised discussion commence!

Boo! Telling someone of my engagement with social media tech early on (I got better, few lasting symptoms). Twitter ID! I was user ~1,200 out of now 530 million. API cuts seem to have hidden this. Profile does say I joined Nov 2006, it launched July 2006, but that isn't as funny.

"Rosso di sera bel tempo si spera" = "Red sky at night, good weather hopefully"

Mercy. Nothing fake here. Trump has openly declared himself on a Nazi platform, promoting himself as a dictator in _exactly_ the same way as Hitler did.

Before continuing in a spiel you can predict, a point I believe is worthy of attention. Humans are intelligent. We evolved through cooperation. Taking instruction from a tribe leader can be a mutually beneficial pattern, let them do the organisation, that's their job. We trust them to act in everyone's benefit, hopefully can complain about Mabel's goat eating my cloth, resolve conflict. It's the hardest job, gold offerings, fine. We are grateful.
But the dynamics change when people are under threat. Food running out, a tiger on the prowl.

I believe most German people of the 1930s can be forgiven for not seeing quite what lay ahead, it was a new evil for everyone (perhaps in the ancient world, not living memory).

Standard of living for your Average Joe (oops, not best name choice, Joseph) was not good. Naturally people were attracted to any offer of hope for a better life.
