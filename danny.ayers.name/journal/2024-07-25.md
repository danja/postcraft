# Hotter

I spent the morning on #Paperless (mostly struggling with Docker, again), just had a hour or two on fairly grim family stuff. So for a bit of fun, I'll have a look at #glamouroustoolkit . I'd left it open in a browser tab yesterday.

**that script looks great in the terminal!**

### Paperless

latest version is at https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx

[Management utilities](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/administration/#management-commands)

tweaked `docker-compose.yml` :

```
    volumes:
      - data:/usr/src/paperless/data
      - media:/usr/src/paperless/media
      - ./export:/usr/src/paperless/export
      - /home/danny/Documents/aaaINDEXED:/usr/src/paperless/consume
```

```
cd /home/danny/AI/paperless-ngx
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

This errored. `systemctl` check - docker was disable!? Enabled, rebooted.

Paperless docs say :

> With Docker Compose, while paperless is running:

```
$ cd /path/to/paperless
$ docker compose exec webserver <command> <arguments>
```

so I tried-

```
docker compose exec webserver document_index reindex
```

That ran, but doesn't seem to have picked up on my dir changes.

```
cd /home/danny/AI/paperless-ngx
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
```

`docker-ce` and `docker-compose` are in apt repo.

```
sudo nano /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/compose/cli/docker_client.py

  kwargs = kwargs_from_env(environment=environment)
# kwargs = kwargs_from_env(environment=environment, ssl_version=tls_version) danny

...
danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/paperless-ngx$ docker-compose build
broker uses an image, skipping
db uses an image, skipping
webserver uses an image, skipping
```

```
cd /home/danny/AI/paperless-ngx
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker compose exec webserver document_index reindex
```

`docker-compose.env` add :

```

```
