# Whelmed

I typed that title yesterday, nothing else. [Whelm](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/whelm) (_to cover or engulf_) is archaic, its [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/whelm) is rather muddled, Germanic somehow. Here, I'll have it to contrast with _overwhelmed_, how I was earlier in the week. One of my many mental flaws is that I'm prone to getting into that state. I know it'll be temporary, but it's not nice at the time. Nowadays it's nowhere as problematic for me as it used to be. I'm much more aware of what brings it on : a particular kind of uncertainty/insecurity.

I like the sound of the word whelm, it sounds very underwhelming, like _whim_. There's a nice use of that in an episode of Blackadder - not immediately findable so here's [Baldrick's maths lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IQjUpTNVU) instead. (Coincidentally I'm also hopeless at elementary arithmetic, but that's another story.)

## Plan

syncthing - sorted - I'd forgotten I had a VPN running on the phone...

Two main things today:

1. #FOAFRetrospective stuff - didn't get started
2. No.7 cantina plumbing - done, as best I can

There are a load of diverse things for 1. As a quick push-pin in the map, I'll pull in something danbri said the other day (it's the man himself that's motivated me to do this) :

> I think for foaf collecting raw materials is key

Like the most interesting or impactful things that ever used it

Or ongojng use in linkeddata datasets

Skos is also kind of needing the same but is probably another story
