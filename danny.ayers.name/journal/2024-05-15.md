Slow progress on #Postcraft.

Yesterday I spent a very long time trying to figure out why, although I had `s:Unfork` working in isolation, it wasn't working after `s:DirWalker`. I got it working, but haven't a clue what the problem was. Note to self : write more tests.

I just spent 2 hours trying to figure out why my RDF handling code wasn't working after a `switch(x){ case y: ... }`.
Foooolish Danny. I'd forgotten to put `return` in the `case` blocks

I wasn't getting the properties I needed in the context to render the front page. But now I believe I am.

```
{
  "rootDir": "/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name",

  "siteURL": "https://danny.ayers.name",
  "subdir": "blog",

  "indexPage": {
    "filepath": "public/blog/index.html",
    "templateFilename": "layouts/mediocre/index-page_template.html"
  },

  "filepaths": [
    "2024-05-03_one.md",
    "2024-05-03_two.md"
  ],
}
```

Ok, I'm no longer concerned with the original markdown files, so before going any further I'll change `filepaths` to `slugs`. These will include the local subdirs leading to the slug proper, but no need to worry about that now.
Especially since I noticed that `s:DirWalker` isn't recursing properly.

Front page is rendering - **Major milestone reached!!!**

TODO include milestone screen shot here

The code is _so_ buggy & hacky, and the current end result _so_ ugly. But it's working end-to-end.

There's a massive amount of code tidying & refactoring to do, but that's not one of the priorities right now. They are:

- Make the pages pretty enough to put online, and put online
- Organise the TODOs so that I'm clear what needs doing
- Write the 'Hello (again) World!' post

I've done enough prep for these that they shouldn't take too long.

Next I need to sort out my plans for #FOAF-Retrospective. I'll be needing #Transmissions & #Postcraft in various places for that, so all this will still be getting attention.

I **must avoid yak shaving** but as I'm sorting out all the TODOs, I should keep an eye on the project management project bigger picture.

### Plan
