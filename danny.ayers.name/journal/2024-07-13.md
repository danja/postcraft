### FOAF Video Cleanup

Recommendations

#### For Upscaling:

RealSR (Upscale Realistic): This model is designed for realistic upscaling, which is suitable for an academic presentation video as it will preserve the natural look and details.

SPAN (Upscale General + Animation): This model can handle general upscaling tasks well and might be a good option if RealSR is too resource-intensive.

#### For Interpolation:

IFRNET (Interpolate General): This is a general-purpose interpolation model and should be less demanding on resources compared to RIFE. It can help smooth out the video and improve its overall appearance.
RIFE (Interpolate General): Although generally effective, it can be more demanding. If IFRNET does not yield satisfactory results, consider RIFE as an alternative.
