# TODAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY AI setup, again

This is still working towards **hyperdata.it reboot**, but I need a bit better AI support.

[LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) is a front end to _any AI_. I installed it a few weeks ago, it seemed very good

previously is in LibreChat Notes 2024-05-30

fuseki's browser-based admin interface uses the authentication to can see in the request headers below. I'd like to allow a user authenticated this way to use other pages on the site https:/hyperdata.it, without having to log in and out again. How? Please check Fuseki docs and/or code to see how it is done there. The other server-side code uses nodejs (in es module style) and I believe the passport libs might be useful.

└── server/
    └── server.js
