## AI Support

The other day I had a play with [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/), which is a chatbot frontend that can be connected to a range of AI services. I got it running on my local machine, have done a `git pull` and have been adding services.

[notes from the other day]()

From [Known Endpoints](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/ai_endpoints) in `librechat.example.yaml` :

- [AnyScale](https://anyscale.com/)
- [API Pie](https://apipie.ai/)
- [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/)
- [GROQ](https://groq.ai/)
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
- [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/)
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) - requires payment first
- [Shuttle AI](https://shuttleai.app/)
- [Together AI](https://api.together.ai/)

I've added API keys for those to my `.env`. (Don't forget to include it in the `.gitignore` before committing!)

Listed in the [endpoints](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/ai_endpoints) but weren't in the sample `.env`, I've also added:

- [Cohere](https://cohere.com)
- [DataBricks](https://databricks.com) - wasn't obvious where to get the API key, left for now

_to be continued..._

It also supports RAG, and somewhere it mentions using HuggingFace for embeddings. So also in my `.env`:

```
RAG_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=huggingface
HF_TOKEN=...
```

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LibreChat$ docker compose ls
danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LibreChat$ docker compose up -d
```

Hmm. It doesn't appear to be picking up the new `.env` settings, even after `docker compose `. Try again later.

## Tidy up Postcraft

The [Transmissions](https://github.com/danja/transmissions) refactoring might take a while, and will no doubt break the setup for [Postcraft](https://github.com/danja/postcraft) in the interim. So I'll do a quick tidy up there first, publish the current material.

ok, `2024-04-27_postcraft-flow.md` says:

```
./run postcraft /home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

I guess that'll be from `danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/transmissions$` - the terminal I have in #Cursor.

Ok, that appears to have run ok. Stuff locally at `http://localhost/danny.ayers.name/public/blog/`
I'll push those changes, then do a quick check of https://danny.ayers.name/

It's there, but without the CSS.

```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/fonts.css" type="text/css" />
```

**Need more coffee!!**

Ok, so with :

```
./run postcraft /home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

it's picking up :

```
/home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/postcraft

./about.md
./services.ttl
./transmission.ttl
```

and then applying that to :

```
/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/manifest.ttl
```

putting the result in :

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/public/blog$ ls
entries  index.html
```

I don't like `./blog` there, `./home` would be better.

what it needs to do but I clearly haven't set up yet is to copy some of this across :

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/layouts/mediocre$ ls
about.md  css  fonts  layout-sample.html  templates
```

So this is _delegation to the max_, but that's ok, intentional separation of concerns.

I forget what **Transmissions services** (in `transmissions/src/services/`) I've got set up around **copy**, one might need to be tweaked/added.
It'll be easiest to run at the start of the pipeline, before things start forking.
That will take its config from `transmissions/src/applications/postcraft/services.ttl`. Which in turn (I think) should take its details from the `manifest.ttl` in the site directory.

I'll need to check what is in place already. While I'm at it, I want to tweak the content folders a bit. New version in [docs/site-template.md](https://github.com/danja/postcraft/blob/main/docs/site-template.md).

Ok, so in `danny.ayers.name/manifest.ttl` I've flipped `blog` to `home` and added :

```
# STYLES ETC
t:CSS a pc:StaticGroup ;
    pc:site <https://danny.ayers.name> ;
    fs:sourceDirectory "layouts/mediocre/css" ;
    fs:targetDirectory "public/home/css" .

... similar for fonts & JS
```

**also need to clean dirs on rebuild** - later

Although I've got a `FileReader` and a `FileWriter`, I don't have a `FileCopy`. I'll add one to the services.

Shortly...

I'll put the config in place in `service.ttl` now, then implement it after a bit of Transmissions refactoring, after dogwalk.

Hmm. I can't remember how I did the delegaty bit. For now I've put this in `services.ttl` as a placeholder :

```
t:copyCSS a trm:FileCopy ;
        trm:key t:cssCopy .

... similar for fonts & JS
```

Yay! I got the change from `execute(data, context)` to `execute(context)` etc. done and it's working with the `postcraft` application. I was dreading that. It may have broken some of the other services, but no biggy, I'll find out as I go along.

I guess I should also rename the `mill` dir to `engine` while I'm at it. Done! That was surprisingly painless too.

So, `FileCopy` service. I also need a `FileRemove` service nearbly, so I might as well set that up too.

Prompt time.

Using @ServiceExample.js as a template, create @FileCopy.js The context object going into execute(context) will have `source` and `destination` keys. The `source` will be a path to a file or directory, the `destination` will be a path to a directory. If `source` is a file, it will be copied to the `destination` directory. If `source` is a directory, the directory and its contents will be copied recursively to the `destination` directory. Include appropriate error handling.

Using @ServiceExample.js as a template, create @FileRemove.js The context object going into execute(context) will have a `remove` key. This will be a path to a file or directory. If it is a file, that file will be deleted. If it is a directory, the directory's contents will be deleted recursively, but not the directory itself. Include appropriate error handling.

Ok, they're sketched out and I've started a little application `file-copy-remove-test` to try them out.
Enough for today.
