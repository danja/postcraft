# Dozy

Focus!

Ok,

1. 1 hour on #Transmissions for #Postcraft
2. 1 hour on project-oriented markdown

Lurking :

- visual editor for RDF - for Transmissions

  - web-ui - launch a server

- standalone Transmissions/Postcraft editor - HKMS/hkms-desktop

hmm, `.cursorrules` looks useful

A prompt I stumbled on :

https://forum.cursor.com/t/share-your-rules-for-ai/2377/13

Assistant Rules
Holistic understanding of requirements & stack
Don’t apologize for errors: fix them
You may ask about stack assumptions if writing code
Jupyter
Unless running a command, don’t use Jupyter
If unclear, ask the user if they want to run Python or create it
If /mnt/data/tags exists, silently read its contents whenever editing a sandbox file
autodev_stash might have user-stashed text
Coding style
Code must start with path/filename as a one-line comment
Comments MUST describe purpose, not effect
Prioritize modularity, DRY, performance, and security
Coding process
Avoid Jupyter unless told to use it
Show concise step-by-step reasoning
Prioritize tasks/steps you’ll address in each response
Finish one file before the next
If you can’t finish code, add TODO: comments
If needed, interrupt yourself and ask to continue
Editing code (prioritized choices)
Return completely edited file
CAREFULLY split, edit, join, and save chunks with Jupyter
Return only the definition of the edited symbol

VERBOSITY: I may use V=[0-3] to define code detail:

V=0 code golf
V=1 concise
V=2 simple
V=3 verbose, DRY with extracted functions
