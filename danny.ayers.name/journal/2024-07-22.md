# Humid

Last week I had a crack at improving the quality of danbri's old FOAD vid. Got as far as necessary for now : https://github.com/danja/video-magic

Now back to #Transmissions.

The next code I need is the `file-copy-remove-test` application, with the necessary service implementations.

I signed up for Claude about a week ago but haven't looked into its features yet. It has Projects.

- https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1dsudc4/how_to_use_claude_projects_for_coding/
- https://github.com/yamadashy/repopack
- [16x](https://prompt.16x.engineer/) - looks promising but is pay-for ($18 lifetime)

```
npm install -g repopack
```

added a config

```
repopack --verbose -c ./repopack.config.json
```

(output path isn't used right)

I've created a project Transmissions on Claude and upload the repopack.

### Prompt

I am working on `src/applications/file-copy-remove-test` This will do the following :

- copy `start/one.txt` into `single-empty/`
- copy `single-empty/one.txt` into `single-full/`
- remove `single-empty/one.txt`

- copy everything in `start/` into `several-empty/`
- copy everything in `several-empty/` into `several-full/`
- remove everything in `several-empty/`
  I want a test like `tests/integration/file-pipeline.spec.js` that will first delete files in `single-empty/`, `single-full/`, `several-empty/`, `several-full/` then execute `node run.js file-copy-remove-test` then check each of those directories in turn to see if their contents fit the requirements above.

...

The application `src/applications/file-copy-remove-test` will use two existing services `src/services/fs/FileCopy.js` and `src/services/fs/FileRemove.js` for the operations. This will need `src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/transmission.ttl` to define the pipeline and `src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/services.ttl` to define the file and directory paths.
