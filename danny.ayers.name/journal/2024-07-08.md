# WTFs

**FOAF vid** for fun, after the following:

Continuing from yesterday - #Transmissions and #Postcraft

Funny, you know how legacy code can be mystifying? My initial setup in Transmissions used messages/process calls of the form `(data, context)`, where `data` would be a string, `context` a `{key:value, ... }` dictionary. Keep it simple...
But I subsequently realised that it'd be better with the dictionary alone (not least because the _actual_ context was defined elsewhere). So I changed the signature to `(context)`, any string data could go in as something like `context.data`.

Yeah. I should do `s/context/message`.

**need to move entry-content-cache somewhere better**

Miracle. That only broke one class, which was a 10 min fix.

I do need to go through _everything_, fix any other issues I've introduced, tidy up, add tests & docs.
Docs especially - I've only got GitHub Copilot to help me out for a few more days.

https://www.librechat.ai/ - rebuild, how?

### [LDAP Account Manager](https://ldap-account-manager.org/lamcms/)

to try. Has downloads but is also Ubuntu repos, so:

```
sudo apt install ldap-account-manager
```

**Stop!** - ew, it has PHP dependencies. I'll leave that for now.

```
There's also a `ldap-account-manager-lamda` package:

> Lamdaemon is part of LDAP Account Manager. This package
> needs to be installed on the server where the home directories
> reside and/or quotas should be managed.
