Ok, continuing from yesterday - #Transmissions and #Postcraft

https://www.librechat.ai/ - rebuild, how?

### [LDAP Account Manager](https://ldap-account-manager.org/lamcms/)

to try. Has downloads but is also Ubuntu repos, so:

```
sudo apt install ldap-account-manager
```

**Stop!** - ew, it has PHP dependencies. I'll leave that for now.

```
There's also a `ldap-account-manager-lamda` package:

> Lamdaemon is part of LDAP Account Manager. This package
> needs to be installed on the server where the home directories
> reside and/or quotas should be managed.
