I'm having a big push trying to get my Postcraft site builder project to something resembling an **MVP**. Resembling, because it isn't intended to be a _Product_. It's hardly going to be _Minimum_ either, I want it presentable enough that I can use it indefinitely as-is, the keyword is _Viable_. Within this, I want everything in place : tests, docs etc, such that I can pick it up again whenever and have a good chance of getting back into the flow.

But **Postcraft** isn't actually much in itself. It's an application of a tool I was calling _Treadmill_ but is now called Transmissions.

This is a general-purpose pipeline runner, with a focus on building static sites. The pipeline is defined in a Turtle file, and the services are implemented as Node.js modules. The pipeline is run by a simple command-line script, which is also a Node.js module.

in itself isn't the main goal, it's a means to an end.

The end is to have a site that I can use to present my work, and to have a platform for further work. The site is a _Personal Knowledge Management System_, a place to collect, organise, and present my thoughts and work. It's a place to think, to write, to code, to experiment, to learn, to teach. It's a place to be me.

It's
I made a silly mistake Treadmill.
I probably should special-case files called `journal_YYYY-MM-DD.md` in `PostcraftPrep.js` to give a title as above.
