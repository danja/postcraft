# Shake the Spaghetti Tree

I reckon one top-level principle of dev methodology is that one size _does not_ fit all.

#TODO : post-hoc, write Transmissions initial requirements

### _Maybe Prompt_

I could do with a concise simile to express the dev process I'm using with Transmission. It should combine these :

1. Small, speculative steps
2. Frequent review
3. You Might* Need It (YMNI) : \_intentionally* go beyond what is immediately necessary to keep options open
4. Throwing spaghetti at the wall, when it sticks, it's done
5. Shake the tree - to dislodge strands that aren't stuck

avoid premature optimisation -

## Experience

execute(data, context) was a mistake

tendency to duplicate functionality

RDF can be very painful

RDF-Ext - there must be a better way!!!!
