# Journal : 2024-05-10

Ok, for TODOs, I'll have a top-level `todo/index.md` file, plus monthly files like `todo/2024-05.md`. Then have **Plan** blocks in this journal for daily bits.

### Plan

#### Postcraft

- [ ] :PostcraftPrep + tests, get it to rendering the individual post HTML adequately.
- [ ] :Unfork experiments

#### FOAF-Archive

- [ ] Placeholders + manifest.ttl for FOAF-Archive
- [ ] FOAF video

#### Kaggle-Preferences

- [ ] get set up, run the demo
