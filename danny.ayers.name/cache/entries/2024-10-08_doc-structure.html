    <h1>Postcraft Docs</h1>
<p><em>proper doc links etc. will follow soon, so if you want to know more, most of the material I&#39;m talking about is up at GitHub danja</em></p>
<p>#:todo #:tldr tl;dr handling</p>
<p>I&#39;ll mostly be posting stuff here (and nearby) in these categories :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>articles</strong> for quasi-complete, permanent-ish material</li>
<li><strong>entries</strong> for things like trad blog posts, of the moment but relatively single-topic, self-contained</li>
<li><strong>journal</strong> for <em>anything</em>, mostly notes as I&#39;m going along, very unlikely to make much sense on their own</li>
<li><strong>todo</strong> daily notes-to-self etc</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be a week or two before I get around to making these accessible online, I need to do a bit of work on site layout/templating. But I am gradually starting to capture my keyboard-hammering more systematically.</p>
<p>After having this part up for a few weeks I&#39;ve inadvertently drifted into randomly dumping stuff from the 4 categories here. Today, I attempt restarting self-discipline. (I am concurrently working on UI bits that some time soon should help me with this).</p>
<p>Boo! Internet connection has dropped...</p>
<p>#:postcraft (an is just at a stage where I can use it, so as I&#39;ve been organizing my projects I&#39;ve been dogfooding by using it to capture documentation.</p>
<p>It occurred to me quite early on that it&#39;ll be fine to drop in to pretty much every project because the overhead is actually very low. (Will be even lower once I move the layout bits etc. to a common area).</p>
<p>The current default dir structure for #:postcraft material looks like this :</p>
