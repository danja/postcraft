    <h1>Tibicos</h1>
<p>Oriana&#39;s due back from Switzerland today, I&#39;ve been looking after her water kefir, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibicos">tibicos</a> (fascinating stuff). I need to prep a few other things for her return, but first an hour on #form-a-matic.</p>
<p>I need to set up publishing of Farelo&#39;s Postcraft asap for docs on form-a-matic, but that should be straightforward. Form-a-matic will need a little thought, at 13:11 on a rainy day my head is up for that.</p>
<ul>
<li>publish hyperdata subprojects</li>
</ul>
