    <h1>Shake the Spaghetti Tree</h1>
<p>I reckon one top-level principle of dev methodology is that one size <em>does not</em> fit all.</p>
<p>#TODO : post-hoc, write Transmissions initial requirements</p>
<h3><em>Maybe Prompt</em></h3>
<p>I could do with a concise simile to express the dev process I&#39;m using with Transmission. It should combine these :</p>
<ol>
<li>Small, speculative steps</li>
<li>Frequent review</li>
<li>You Might* Need It (YMNI) : _intentionally* go beyond what is immediately necessary to keep options open</li>
<li>Throwing spaghetti at the wall, when it sticks, it&#39;s done</li>
<li>Shake the tree - to dislodge strands that aren&#39;t stuck</li>
</ol>
<p>avoid premature optimisation -</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>execute(data, context) was a mistake</p>
<p>tendency to duplicate functionality</p>
<p>RDF can be very painful</p>
<p>RDF-Ext - there must be a better way!!!!</p>
