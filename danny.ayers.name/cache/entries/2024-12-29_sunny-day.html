    <h1>Sunny Day</h1>
<p><em>It&#39;s a sunny Sunday day.</em></p>
<p>My must-dos for today are plumbing. Actual plumbing :</p>
<ul>
<li>Sealant on leaky pipe at No.7</li>
<li>Fix the <em>second</em> hole I hadn&#39;t seen under the sink here at #:New place</li>
</ul>
<p>I also really need to make a start on some tree removal while the weather&#39;s dry. Stretching the notion of plumbing, first I need to sort out climbing gear, ropes, pulleys etc.</p>
<p>Financial plumbing, I need to sort a stack of papers, find the relevant forms I have somewhere, to sort out pension flow from Derbyshire County Council. I had a small (but very useful) monthly sum coming from there. Caroline worked at a DCC special needs place for a few years, I inherited her pension. It stalled a couple of months ago, I missed some kind of update step. I did do a little towards sorting it out, in the process discovered that I&#39;m probably due some funds from the years I worked at High Peak College.</p>
<p>Software plumbing...things to join together. Separate posts here for them.</p>
