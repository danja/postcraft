    <h1>Lark</h1>
<p><em>I&#39;m at desk by 9:50, that me up with the lark.</em></p>
<p>So much to do...</p>
<p>December, ok. That means I can start <code>danny.ayers.name/todo/2024-12.md</code>. I&#39;m still juggling the todo lists, that file will point to project-specific files like <code>transmissions/todo</code>, and each of these areas has a <code>todo/next-steps.md</code>.</p>
<p>This tells me I need to push #:farelo (project management stuff) up my priorities. That depends to a great extent on my knowledge base. I&#39;ve got a significant amount of local content-knowledge, but navigating it is painful, I need to get #:semem running.</p>
<p>Sifting the above points me to <code>danny.ayers.name/entries/2024-11-29_carrot.md</code>, writing down the project descriptions and todos quasi-formally (markdown that can be transformed into RDF and used in #:farelo) under <code>danny.ayers.name/projects</code>.</p>
<p>#:todo use the word &#39;sift&#39; more frequently, it&#39;s more visualisable than &#39;filter&#39;
#:todo use the word &#39;primitives&#39; in #:transmissions docs (I heard it used in a tech podcast I heard 5 minutes of before getting up, it&#39;ll be useful)</p>
<p>But first thing today, tidy up some nuts &amp; bolts in #:transmissions.</p>
<p>Before that, I need to get the latest Claude export.</p>
<p><code> &lt;antArtifact identifier=&quot;project-handover&quot; type=&quot;text/markdown&quot; title=&quot;Resource Ontology Project Handover&quot;&gt;</code></p>
<p><strong>14:17</strong> When I went to my todos, they were lacking structure. So I did a little #:yak around #:MarkMap. Just had a #:dogwalk, back to desk :</p>

<p>I need to do a bit on #:squirt !!</p>
<p>posters : #:squirt, #:chauvin, #:semem</p>
<ul>
<li><p>#:fam - refactor for #:transmission - so it uses processors, but has <code>simple.js</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>#:farelo-proximate, update #:trellis, #:foolicious, #:foowiki using #:fam - RDF-Ext inside</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the RDF vocabularies you know of together with those in your project knowledge, please create an rdf/owl turtle version of the Model Context Protocol schema...</p>
