    <h1>Two Steps Back</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve spent the past few hours at desk going around in circle with module loading in #:transmissions. Most of this was down to my over-reliance on Claude AI. The code required for core operations is just a bit too complex.</p>
<p>But one reason for this will be my use of repopack as-is for project knowledge. I need RAG material to be custom to the target. My own repopack.</p>
<p>Need docs.</p>
<p>A refactoring first : execute() -&gt; process()</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">grep -r execute | grep &quot;.js&quot; | grep -v &quot;^processors&quot;

grep -r &quot;process&quot; | grep &quot;.js&quot;

grep -r &quot;.js&quot; | grep -v &quot;^processors&quot; | grep &quot;process&quot;

grep -r &quot;execute&quot; | grep -v &quot;^node_modules&quot; | grep &quot;.md&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;execute(&quot; with &quot;process(&quot;</p>
