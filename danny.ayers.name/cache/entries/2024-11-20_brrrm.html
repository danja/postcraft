<p><em>I just got a phone call for a survey about traffic in Rome. And it&#39;s cold again.</em></p>
<p>I spent a little time on #:transmissions module loading earlier. Just now did a new install of #:pulsar, and luckily it picked up the bits from <code>~/.pulsar</code>. No rush to update #:hyperdata-desktop.</p>
<p>A little bit more setup of #:semem, finally it let me install #:Jasmine.</p>

<p>Naturally I&#39;ve added a bit more to the todos, but more of a priority shift than anything really new. The #:ns stuff is pressing, as is #:farelo, specifically #:fam.</p>
<p>I really want to crack on with applications, but the #:transmissions module stuff (&amp; refactoring) is a bit of a blocker.</p>
<p>Heh, and there is also <em>hookers</em> in progress...</p>
