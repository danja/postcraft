    <h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Project docs are a priority for me right now. But interdependencies are crazy-convoluted.</p>
<p>First problem is identifying the projects...</p>
<p>Most of the things I&#39;ve been most active with recently are still early-stage as Claude projects and/or on notes I&#39;ve got scattered around, or in repos which appear two dirs on my office machine. I&#39;ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>First I need to remind myself where I was up to with :</p>
<ul>
<li>#:tbox - a Docker container for <em>stuff</em>, most relevant right know, <strong>knowledgebases</strong></li>
<li>#:semem - a <strong>knowledgebase interface</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>tbox</h2>
<p>Hah! I&#39;d got further than I remembered. The Job One <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/">Fuseki SPARQL Server</a> is already in place. Exposed at <a href="http://localhost:4030">http://localhost:4030</a></p>
<p>Looks like I got <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody IM Server</a> in there too, but I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t tested.</p>
<p>I need to get #:transmissions and other core #:hyperdata projects in here too.</p>
<p>Because I need #:semem to organise my existing docs.</p>
<p><strong>I saved a link about setting up Docker as a dev container, best read that first.</strong></p>
<h2>semem</h2>
<p>Dog walk now, coffee with Mari &amp; plumbing supplies run soon. </p>
