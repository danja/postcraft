    <h1>Hoard</h1>
<p><em>hyperdata-whiteboard</em></p>
<p>I got distracted yesterday while sorting out the #:packer #:transmission (for concat&#39;ing repos for LLMs), then in the evening, when I got back to desk I was too tired to do anything, gave up. Returning to it now, I need a small repo to run it against. As it happens, this morning in bed, a passing thought led me to start another[^1] little whiteboard project (with Claude). I&#39;ll make that a new project.</p>
<p>Online, I&#39;ve created <a href="https://github.com/danja/hoard">https://github.com/danja/hoard</a></p>
<p>Locally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages
git submodule add https://github.com/danja/hoard.git hoard
cd hoard
npm init -y
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, so now I can try :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
./trans packer ../hyperdata/packages/hoard
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, it fails as expected...</p>
<p>My head&#39;s a little fuzzy and Claudio&#39;s pestering. Dogwalk time.</p>
<p>[^1] I&#39;ve been around whiteboards a few times before, first time of note being a <a href="https://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/11/19/svgwiki.html">SVG Wiki Whiteboard</a> in 2003.</p>
