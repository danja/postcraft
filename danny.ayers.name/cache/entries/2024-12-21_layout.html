    <h1>Layout</h1>
<p>With Claude&#39;s help (I gave the <code>index.html</code> + CSS files as attachments), I&#39;ve fixed the immediate layout bug I had here. My system prompt (which I&#39;ll post in a mo) asks Claude for suggestions, and after this it suggested :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>q4: Should we implement a sticky header or navigation elements?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sticky menu button was already in my todos, so I went <code>q4</code>. Claude gave me a bunch of code using React.  To which I responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be vanilla JS, please revise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I have a sticky button! I&#39;ll populate it later, daylight activities to do.</p>
<p>When I tried it on my phone it still wasn&#39;t quite right, but clearing the cache sorted it out. So I&#39;ve added this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- #:todo remove when stable --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; content=&quot;no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The stuff here is all lightweight, so that may stay a while.</p>
<p>All good!</p>
