    <h1>Pivots</h1>
<p><em>Thinking aloud to find the actionables</em>.</p>
<p>Two artificial deadlines I want to set myself. I&#39;ve got some vocab in-progress for expressing these, the term being #:pivot. There are two dates coming soon for good markers :</p>
<ol>
<li>Poggi Pivot : Mari&#39;s birthday, 2024-01-05</li>
<li>Proof Pivot : my birthday, 2024-01-14</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one, primary goal is getting <strong>some</strong> docs online for <strong>all</strong> my currently active projects. Skeleton summaries/placeholders at minimum, the #:what, a little #:how. But I really want to capture how they relate to each other, the #:why. </p>
<p>The second one, primary goal is creating a proof-of-concept for each project. The minimum here again is little more than skeletal placeholders. But again, capture of the interrelations is the part I&#39;m aiming for. Get the overall dependency graph formalised enough that it can be used in planning. It&#39;s twisty.</p>
<p>Ok, I&#39;ve got actionables (not far off what I was doing already). For #:PoggiPivot, first step is to wire up all the #:postcraft spaces, make them live.
In quasi-parallel, towards #:ProofPivot, two must-haves : write down core project description for each, maybe in a proposal-like form; write down the #:poc requirements.</p>
<p>This lot in itself is a major grind. But I need to remind myself where I&#39;m up to with everything. Best way to do this and keep it interesting is to see what I have noted for next step #:todos, code up the next little step.</p>
<p>I just did this with #:tbox. While going over it with Claude he gave me an architectural diagram (in Mermaid format) which I found really helpful. I&#39;ve already got visualisations on the lists, but I reckon this is an aspect I should revisit very soon, to help with <em>everything else</em>.</p>
