    <h1>Form-a-matic</h1>
<p>Prompted by my need to capture project/task descriptions I&#39;ve been wondering how to automate UI generation.</p>
<p>I can use #Transmissions for this!</p>
<ol>
<li>upload vocab RDF to a SPARQL store</li>
<li>run selective query</li>
<li>render results as a form with checkboxes to tag desired properties</li>
<li>submit back to SPARQL store</li>
<li>query again</li>
<li>render results as a FOAF-a-matic style form</li>
</ol>
<p>I will need a few new Transmissions services. Claude can help a lot, I&#39;d better leave this until I have access again.</p>
<p>Easiest wiring would be to use the #SPARQL-Diamonds trick. But using #RDF-Ext would also be nice, no store dependency.</p>
