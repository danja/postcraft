    <h1>Brrr</h1>
<p>NOTE TO SELF : GRDDL</p>
<p><em>it&#39;s chilly</em></p>
<p><em>four times I&#39;ve changed the date in this&#39; filename. It is still chilly</em></p>
<p>Aside from some priority #:todos I won&#39;t forget, I have :</p>
<ol>
<li>#:todo <code>/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/todo/next-steps.md</code></li>
<li>#:todo Verbo photo</li>
<li>#:todo carving prep</li>
<li>#:todo 1-page docs (Transmissions urgent)</li>
</ol>
<p>No. 1. here is :</p>
<h2>Restructure</h2>
<p>A #:transmissions processor that changes the shape of a (JSON) message.</p>
<p>Notes in Transmissions Journal #:todo link, today in :
<code>/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/journal/2024-11-15.md</code></p>
<p>I need to use <code>Restructure</code> in two places right away :</p>
<ol>
<li>render messages from Claude&#39;s <code>conversations.json</code></li>
<li>get <code>README.md</code>s from all my GitHub repos</li>
<li>tidy up #:postcraft, sort out publishing things.</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1. I also needed a <code>JSONWalker</code>.</p>
<p>I got hopelessly confused...</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent way too long on these as <em>necessary tasks</em>, but it has useful as a learning experience.</p>
<p>At many points I was tempted to simply hack the code for 1. &amp; 2. but at some point last week I broke the #:postcraft transmission in the parts that involve restructuring, so INSERT TOKI PONA</p>
<p>strange, the message is sometimes undefined...</p>
<h2>Transmissions</h2>
<p>I&#39;m so desperate to automate this thing! My current process with Claude is close, just needs a little bit more push...</p>
<p>What I&#39;m lacking in the #:transmissions dev is immediacy and integration, like you get in Smalltalk. MORE - it&#39;s not engaging me. I need to be told why I should do something.</p>
<p>Near future, I&#39;ll have #:hyperdata-desktop for that. In the interim...</p>
<p>I guess I should try Cline.</p>
