# TODO in 2025, become a millionaire

Don't laugh, this is serious!

I'll write it up better later, but a dated marker was needed.

This occurred to me the other day.

Many "normal" motivations don't work for me, my bag of #:adhd. On a rational level I know I (urgently) need to make some money to pay the bills (and avoid ending up with court action from Gaia, the water suppliers). "Get some paid work" - yeah, **I know** (and at this point in time, my previously-niche skillset makes me eminently employable). But there is a gap between knowing and action. For me it doesn't work like that.

But **_reframed_**, I can trick myself. "Make €1m in 2025" as a goal, yeah, course I can do that.

The actuality of the €1m itself remains to be seen, but the actually of the _actions_ needed to get there have already begun. And might just keep me out of debtor's gaol.
