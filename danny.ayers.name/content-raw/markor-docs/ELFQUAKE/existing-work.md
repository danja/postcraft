The research project you're referring to is likely the study titled "Earthquake Forecasting Using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence: A 30‐Week Real‐Time Case Study in China." This study was published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America in 2023. The research involved a collaborative effort by scientists from various institutions including the Seismology Department of the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Egypt, TexNet Research and the Center for Integrated Seismicity Research at the University of Texas at Austin, and several departments of Zhejiang University in China. The paper discusses the use of big data and AI for real-time earthquake forecasting in China, emphasizing the advancements and challenges in this field [[❞]](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article-abstract/113/6/2461/627949/Earthquake-Forecasting-Using-Big-Data-and).

Additionally, there's related research that explores the impact of climatic factors on seismic events. A study published in Frontiers highlights the relationship between climate change and geological occurrences, including earthquakes. It emphasizes the complexity of predicting earthquakes, particularly due to the non-linear nature of geophysical processes that lead to seismic events. This research also notes the impact of climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, on seismic activity, and the challenges faced in accurately predicting earthquakes due to these complex relationships [[❞]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1082832/full). 

These studies represent significant strides in the understanding of earthquake prediction using a combination of seismic data, climatic factors, and advanced computational methods.
