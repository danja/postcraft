The English idiom "to kill two birds with one stone" expresses a very useful concept (to achieve two things with a single action) in a horrible way. I was pleased to find that the Italian equivalent "prendere due piccioni con una fava" is less violent - to catch two pigeons with one bean. There are other variants around Europe [^1]. My geo is terrible, no idea which country has "roast two pieces meat on one fire", but again that's a bit less nasty.

 I'd like a pleasant English version and to find that, getting it to work in the language of good seems a good approach. So how would you express this in toki pona?
