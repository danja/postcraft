Toki Pona is a minimalist constructed language, known for its small vocabulary and simple grammar. Here are three phrases that relate to the scenario of a man and his dog relaxing on a couch in front of a wood fire, watching TV:

1. **jan li pini lon tomo** - "The man is resting in the house." This phrase communicates that the man is at rest or relaxing, a key part of your scenario.

2. **soweli li poka jan** - "The animal is beside the man." This phrase indicates that the dog (referred to as an animal in Toki Pona) is next to the man, suggesting they are both on the couch.

3. **seli li lon tomo; jan li lukin e sitelen tawa** - "Fire is in the house; the man is watching moving pictures." This phrase combines two concepts: the presence of fire (which can imply a wood fire in the context) and the man watching something that moves (implying watching TV).

Toki Pona's simplicity requires combining basic concepts to convey more complex ideas, as seen in these phrases.
