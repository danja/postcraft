Medical history and clinical findings: He reports hepatosteatosis, possible exogenous causes

Ultrasound Liver normal in shape and size, regular surfaces, fine homogeneous echostructure, normal echogenicity, no significant foci. Moderately elevated hepatic sw elastography approximately 14 kPa average mindray system), bile ducts, hepatic veins and portal veins normal, continuous normodirect portal flow with normal speed, modulated hepatic venous flow, normal pancreas, thin wirsung, alithiasic gallbladder, spleen with bipolar diameter in the limits, homogeneous, with normal echostructure and echogenicity. Kidneys with normal trophism, regular surfaces, normal volume, absence of signs of abstrution, normal abdominal aorta and collaterals, bladder and prostate (22 ml) within limits. No abdominal lymph nodes with pathological characteristics, no free peritoneal fluid.

Conclusions: Significant alterations on ultrasound, liver function to be evaluated for increase in elastographic values
