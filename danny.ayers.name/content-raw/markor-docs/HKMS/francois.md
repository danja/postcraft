Hi Fran√ßois, and season's greetings!

When you have a minute, if you please, I have a request that would help me on two levels:

What resources would you recommend re. PKGs: papers, sites, vocabs, people etc? 

Rather a lot of unnecesary background below, Feel free not to read on :)

Your post re. the PKG book (congrats!) reminded me. (Alas my bank account says I can't buy books right now).

I've been working on such a system. I just shocked myself seeing just how long, first incarnation (Java app using Jena for RDF) more than 20 years ago!

More recently I've been using in-browser JS apps against a remote SPARQL store. This approach was working well : the apps could be independent of each other (though using common libs), loosely-coupled by the data.
But work demands meant I had to leave that on the shelf for while. 

A rewrite was necessary anyway, also I'd been neglecting a core part I wanted (semi-automatic project-oriented features). And then, LLMs!!!
So I'm starting again, essentially from scratch, with AI model interfacing a new core requirement (emphasis on small, customized models).

The second way any resource suggestions you have can help me is in this use case : How could my system receive and integrate them into the PKG effectively?
(This time around I'm going to be led largely by what I personally need at any given time, trying not to over-plan).
Thanks!
