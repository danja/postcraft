Ok, that took a lot longer than it should have. Something not quite right with how I was configuring proxy+certs to use the webadmin. Given up on that for now, but it looks like ssh-ing in and doing the commands on the server worked.  
I've created 5 users :

alice@hyperdata.it Muddy_432
bob, chris, danbri, danja - same password.

two muc rooms : shed@conference.hyperdata.it, outhouse@conference.hyperdata.it
