The easier way to do any kind of pregaming lab stuff is to set up a VM with Ubuntu server or any other distro with ssh and then running visual studio code on your computer and connecting to the VM through ssh. With Python I suggest using poetry for environment management and then you can also run Jupyter notebooks in visual studio code and you donâ€™t need to bother with the actual web interface.
