A document presentation/HTML/UI question...musing.

Say I have a write-up of a small project, like, "Making a Picture Frame from Scratch". Total material, call it equivalent to 5 fairly densely printed pages of A4.

Online, it wouldn't be terrible as one long web page or many shorter ones. But it would likely be hard to navigate, hard to digest. 
There are fairly clear partitions in the information - for want of a better phrase, call them conceptual dimensions. Some bits are technical, some bits informal personal narrative, some bits only tangentially relevant. All of these have levels of detail. Zoomed out, the whole thing could be squeezed into a single-paragraph summary.

But here's the key thing - different readers will prefer different views. Someone just looking out of mild curiosity or for light entertainment would be better served with the narrative. Someone looking to make their own picture frame would want to skip the fluff.

Ok, there are some common paradigms that do this kind of thing - take parametric search. On Amazon you can filter by star-rating, order by price ascending. But that seems massively overcomplicated for this picture framing article. Especially given that the aim is to make navigation easier.

Soo... a bit more context for why I'm mulling this over. Long story, but the main thing here is I'm (yet again) putting together a little content management setup. This time totally bespoke for *me*. 
I'm already using markdown for writing, wherever possible. It maps to a nice simple subset of HTML. But then with a MD -[process]-> HTML pipeline in place, an irresistible bit is afforded: pop in other processing steps, make up some markdown extensions. I'm my own client here, can make up whatever I fancy.

But when the end result gets exposed over HTTP, the Spanish Inquisition appears. Standards, best practices, y tal y tal...
So going back to the picture frame piece, I'm guessing putting some declarative attributes in the HTML would be the way to go. Maybe <p class="narrative">yadda yadda</p> or whatever.

Here I start to stumble due to my ignorance of 2024's HTML+CSS. I can imagine some JS triggered by checkboxes to hide/show/highlight chunks of the material. But I don't know, having the rendering determined by a bit of ad hoc JS seems somehow *too* quick and dirty... Or am I just overthinking that?

Then stepping back to the markdown, what might be a lightweight bit of custom syntax to semantically tag regions?

Incidentally, I've written this in the Markor text/markdown editor on my phone. Syncthing will copy it over to a 'content' dir on my desktop machine. That's tucked away in a git repo that's also on GitHub. When I next push locally/pull on my server, it'll be online in its raw form. It's not exactly a polished publishing (/backup) system, but good enough for step 0.

Oh yeah, I'm pasting this up on FB because I reckon the folks I know here are less likely to knee-jerk recommend arcane & bloated Framework X.
