Anchors?

Blocks

[# block start, this is the ID

#] block end, this is ignored

Can someone please sanity check me on a markup thing, now markdown is my preferred writing format. 

It's great, but lacks features that would make my life easier. Top of the list, simple annotation/embedded data - tangential to presentation, I'm sure this is legit.

But looking at how I take notes, some UI failings were obvious. On a given mini-topic, I'll record random ideas, plans/procedures, descriptive prose and collect links. Currently I'll do this either with corresponding files in a dir or in a single longish file. 

But with separate files, not only is it a pain flipping between tabs/panes, but somehow stuff always gets messed up between them. 
In a single file (open once), scrolling pain and again, mess, duplication & incoherence.

So what about a little extension to markdown that says a block in the text is to be rendered/editable separately? For translating to HTML for static rendering, just pop in attributes that can be used by CSS flexbox or whatever. For editing the markdown, something near to that with electron.js.

[I think my solution just clicked in my head, but I'll continue anyway]

But, going down this path - features for genuine needs, fine; to make life easier, fine; layout/UI related aspects, hmm...
Isn't this getting rather like HTML 2.x?

Ah but, the solution above that should work for me, a tweak leveraging an existing feature seems keeping with the spirit of markdown, ie. good cost/benefit re. extra complexity.
