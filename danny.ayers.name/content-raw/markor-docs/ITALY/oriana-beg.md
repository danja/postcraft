I've discovered I've made a mess of my finances this month (I'm not good at the best of times, but the visit to my mother last month was a big distraction). I need to find an extra â‚¬100 in the next few days to pay my internet services bill. If you could advance me this from advance rent without it causing a problem for you, it would be very helpful. If not, don't worry, I'll find it some other way.
