I had a fabulous experience last night up at the Medieval Festa in Castiglione. I'd been at my desk most of the day, by about 6pm I was ready for a beer. After weeks of hot sun it was threatening a storm, the breeze made walking up easier than I expected. I had a couple of beers at Silvano's, then had a little walk around. A little street market including a stall selling Wicker Man accessories. Several pop-up food places.
The festa, like most secular events around here, was mostly about food. No-one I knew eating in the piazza, so I
called on Mari to deliver some plums, about ready to walk home.
None of that was at all fabulous. But what was : necci!

They're like a soft, thin tortilla made with chestnut flour. Garfagnana is a chestnut forest, the flour was a staple. Necci are usually filled with ricotta. A traditional treat here. 

I'm acquainted with the guys that were making them (they were/are in the football team?). Entertaining to watch in the 'kitchen'. The expressions on their faces switched between "What am I doing? I could be out enjoying myself" to intense concentration, pressing the necci or expertly spreading with ricotta and/or Nutella.
Yes, Nutella.

I have had necci a few times before at similar events, but always with ricotta alone. Nutella was probably available, but it's a bit to sweet for me. Usually. The thing is, for me, the ricotta-only versions have always been a bit disappointing. You expect them to be sweet and nutty, but they're more like savouries, not unlike Derbyshire oatcakes.

This time I went for it. Ricotta & Nutella. I got outside the town walls before taking a bite, heading homewards. Hmm... That is even less tasty than last time, it's like brown paper! When I got into the light I saw I'd taken a bite of brown paper.

So I sat down to eat it. Absolutely delicious. 
A totally fabulous experience. Thanks guys!
