Is anyone familiar with fig trees? Any advice on caring for them and encouraging fruit appreciated.

Coming from the north of England, even after 20 years here they still seem exotic. I have a very small (overgrown) field, 3 trees. (Garfagnana, alt. ~450m). I have no idea how to look after them.

One mature tree is as it should be. Another I suspect is actually several trees now. It's in line with where Enel clear paths for the overhead cables, one year I didn't catch them in time, chainsaw attack. It looks like the main part did survive, some of the cuttings established themselves separately. But the field is jungle right now, can't see the ground.

The third tree is my main concern. Three (?) years ago Marinella really wanted a fig tree, got a young one, but didn't really have a better place to put it. Welcome to Mozzanella little tree.

Last year, all three got to the stage of fruit developing, but all stalled long before they got anywhere near ripe. 
Now, the young tree is thriving, new green leaves arrived just in the past couple of weeks. But little fruits starting next to every leaf - in April - can that be normal!?
The sensible mature tree near it is a little behind. Less leaf activity, maybe only 1/20 the fruit babies.
The Enel-generated swarm is also a bit slower, but more similar to the youngster, has quite a few mini-fruits.

All 3 need a lot of clearing around, but that's where my knowledge ends. Is there any particular fertiliser I should give them? Pruning somehow?

So, any advice?
