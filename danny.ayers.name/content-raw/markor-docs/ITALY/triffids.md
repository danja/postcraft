I absolutely love this house. But the grey pebbledashed walls, whilst functional, are not pretty. (One of reasons I've put it on Google Maps as 'Mozzanella Polytechnic'). 
Federico next door had wisteria growing crazily up the lamp post. That was really pretty for the couple of weeks it was in flower, but looked a mess the rest of the year. Their garden is lovely: I believe it's known as an 'English lawn'
