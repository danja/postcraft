@thewreckeric was just mentioned on @BBC6Music, wonderful reminder - I haven't heard this song for years! My brother got his first LP when it came out, 1978. That's all good but this single is absolute perfection on every level, a timeless classic. #TypeSpecimen for Teenage Boy's Unrequited Fantasy #LoveSong.

Reading on Wikipedia, incredibly it never made it into the charts. Ah wait, doesn't look like he was on #TOTP, and maybe only John Peel gave him radio play. He was on Granada Reports, presumably Tony Wilson's doing, but that stuff only had a small (but very keen) audience. I lived in the region at the time, so lucky.   


I had an appt this morning which meant I had to be out of the house by 10:45. Very early for me, painful. Something that helped me out of bed : On the radio, the woman who just won the Iron Man Triathlon in Hawaii. 3.9 km ocean swim (with jellyfish), 180.2 km bicycle ride, marathon 42.2 km run, a total of 226.3 km non-stop. She had an Achille's tendon injury, the run all agony.
