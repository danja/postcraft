"There were two guys there, Danny and Nick, who were essentially nocturnal, and apart from the fact that I hardly ever saw them leave the house, they lived a lifestyle very similar to that of a climber. They played guitar and listened to music, and they loved to party. One time they went on a three-day session, from Sunday evening till early on Thursday morning, where they hung out in their room, never going to bed. There were constant shrieks of hysterical high-pitched laughter and really bad guitar strumming. At the time, New Order had just released their single, Blue Monday, and for the three days they played that record over and over again at top volume. Three days. I would go to bed hearing it, get up hearing it, go out training and it would still be on when I got back. They would latch onto particular lines and shout them out over and over again.
'I see a ship in the harbour. I will and shall obey.'"
