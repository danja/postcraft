I had one of those existential "What *am*  I doing!?" moments, the answer made me chuckle, so I stuck it on a short vid.

I posted the link to Marinella, then realised she was bound to respond with "arabo" = "it's all s/Greek/Arabic to me".
She'd understand ok in person, but we communicate in a fairly broken English, low baud rate/Shannon something. A lot of dropped packets, resends.
So...subtitles? I've seen "auto-generated" appear on YouTube before, but they haven't appeared on this, at least not yet. Ok, get a transcript, Google translate, re-record in Italian (I know I can't make it intelligible off the cuff - though I guess I should try as an exercise). Which leads me to needing speech-to-text, 4th time recently, that means I have to act on it. (1. capturing improvised lyrics; 2. wearable gadget for notes; 3. a Vehicle (I've been thinking about the cold-spot detection again, have dug out parts to have a play soon); 4. Vids.

There's a small model with a demo to run on Android. It seemed to be plenty quick enough, but entertainingly bad with my not-exactly-en-us accent. Conveniently an American was speaking on "Murder in Paradise" just now. I think this was close, maybe perfect -

Twitter crashy, one last thing for you on Signal...
