4-button + one or two line console :


StartChar | EndChar

[.       *console*       ]

Menu.      |     Enter


ASCII chars, start whatever seems best, call it A | Z

Touching left char moves the right char to the middle of A and Z, maybe K, leaving A | K

Touch right char, changes to F | K

Right again, 
 
 I | K
 
 Right
 
 J | K
 
 And again, output to console is K
 
 Menu changes functions of corner keys, eg. Enter becomes spacebar.
 
 Predictive text might well help.
