Please read the following for context, then carry out the task that follows.

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.

A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (possibly) unnecessary work. Instead, they iterate on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's requirements.

The MVP is analogous to experimentation in the scientific method applied in the context of validating business hypotheses. It is utilized so that prospective entrepreneurs would know whether a given business idea would actually be viable and profitable by testing the assumptions behind a product or business idea.

Task : create an acronym or short composite term that moves this away from the business world into something more abstract, more generally applicable to any research and development. Bear in mind agile software methodologies.
It will be used as a special case of a marker, a subgoal or milestone with or without any particular target date, but having a small subset of project requirements as a whole.
