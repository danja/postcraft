I need a little medical advice -

I've been very unfocused for the past few weeks. Most problematic is procrastinating badly with the pension things I need to do. It's textbook ADHD stuff biting me.
Why now? I suspect it may be the effect of the SSRI drug. I think it may be counter-productive. I have noticed minor annoying side effects, so it's definitely affecting me. But it seems to be amplifying the problem side of ADHD. Since I started on it I've been finding it harder than ever to stay focused, very prone to getting distracted. 
It's meant to be reducing my anxiety, but that's only been a real problem recently on the UK trips. The Ritalin has reduced my anxiety (and depression) a lot under normal circumstances when I've been here. But since taking the SSRI I have been getting stressed again, because I can't focus. 
I believe this kind of drug takes time to settle, but it has been a few weeks now (I've stayed on 1/2 dose longer than the week Montalbano prescribed because the side effects were a bit unnerving). I don't know know whether to try it for more time, or stop taking it (gradually). 
What would you recommend?
