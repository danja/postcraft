Test hypotheticals, eg.

Give  a model with knowledge of world history prompt update of recent events. Add actual recent events, ask it to predict a few actual future events (some obscure, not newsworthy). Start again, add a novel "secret" that has come to light, eg. presence of aliens in the White House, ask for the same predictions.

Compare predictions against reality.
