This is work that is expected to take a long time over many iterations. Right now I'd just like your views from a high-level perspective and for you to consider how you would approach things.
I'd like some specific vocabulary for use in project managent to capture various concepts in a form aiming to be both human and machine comprehedible. I will give vague descriptions, it will be your job to crystallize the concepts, naming and descriptions into distinct and unambiguous language. Existing terminology is good if the meaning is a close match, reusing analogeous concepts and words from other domains is great, as long as potential for confusion is minimized. Otherwise neologisms are fine, but they must be short and memorable.
The terms and definitions will ultimately form part of a graph knowledgebase expressed in rdf, owl and skos as appropriate, so naming should follow similar patterns. Interoperable use with each other and alignment with other vocabularies will be desirable.
Right now I'd like suggestions to capture the following notions.
I want ways of applying attention to aspects of projects across various conceptual dimensions. Ideas zoom, pan and focus in the filming sense. Eg. You may zoom in to examine individual lines of code or zoom out to consider long-term product development plans. There may be similar usable analogies in other creative media, like amplification, distortion and other effects from audio and music production. Identify some that may have application.
The primary need is first for descriptions of such dimensions to be determined reasonable formally. Next their use in navigating project information will be considered.  Further down the road we will consider ways of navigating and interacting with project and task descriptions through user interfaces.
