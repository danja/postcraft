This is great!

Huge thanks for sharing your code and notes.
 
I doubt you need reminding, but it's worth repeating: when you show your working-out, crit is inevitable. Even when it's given with the best intentions, it can still hurt. Thing is, even when it's really harsh (which is pretty common from fellow coders - we tend to have more arrogance than empathy), it's a positive.
Another pair of eyeballs will see things you don't.

I've got a work deadline in a couple of days I'm running late for, so I can't have a proper look now, despite being very interested. In my own stuff I'm working on agent-based systems, albeit at a different level of abstraction (looking at 'small' but dedicated LLMs + Linked Data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph), how a community might solve problems).

Ok, this is r/generative, where visual art is a goal, but coming at your work from another direction, visualising agent interactions does seem a big step towards understanding them.

I believe your questions here are *very* important more broadly, your work is validated by them popping up. 

How do we identify emergent behaviour? How do we measure cooperation?

I'm sure I've read papers looking at the former, somewhere around deterministic chaos/cellular automata/Alife, somewhere around here, in fact... 
I'm certain work has been done on cooperation metrics, but I can't remember seeing anything in this context. There's probably loads around social sciences statistics. Rather than predator/prey simulations, drug cartels/junkies.

Yeah, as and when I've delivered work-work at the end of the month, I must spend a bit of time with arxiv & Google scholar.

Keep up the good work!

Nearly forgot to say : your animations are very pretty.
