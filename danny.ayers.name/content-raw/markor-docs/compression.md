Quick compression explainer:

You’re playing music in your bedroom. The threshold is the point your mum comes up to tell you to turn it down. Ratio is how much you turn it down by. Attack is how fast she comes to your room, and release is how long you wait before turning it back up again!

Mix bus specifics:

- if you’re working with lots of bass, your attack needs to be slow. If you’re on an SSL bus style comp, most pros I see (myself included) are using 30ms attack and 150ms release as a starting point. 
- you don’t need much gain reduction, we’re talking 2-4dB most of the time.
- In my experience, it sounds best when the drums are making the comp work. 

The ‘glue compression’ ethos is essentially that your big hits like kick and snare get pushed back into your mix, but because the comp is on the master bus you turn down the rest of the track at the same time, which means your drums stay present and clear while being controlled. This also works in the case of vocals if they’re the loudest part. 

Release will determine the ‘vibe’ - you can manipulate the release so any pumping the comp does feels musical.

If you’ve got a lot of low end, that can be an issue with mix bus comps as it’ll take the headroom (low end has more energy and results in more gain reduction) - a few ways you can deal with this are:
1. Use a comp like the API 2500, which has an EQ tilt in the sidechain, meaning the comp is more sensitive to high frequencies. Or find a comp with a sidechain high pass filter
2. Give the bass a boost post compression, and reduce it in the mix - this can work really nicely to tighten up the mix while still leaving the bass sounding open. Pultec low end trick is great for this!
I use a combo of these depending on whether I’m using an SSL or API comp!

Hope that helps :)
