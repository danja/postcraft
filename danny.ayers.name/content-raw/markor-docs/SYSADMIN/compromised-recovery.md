Grrrr! None of my server things were visible from outside, but I could get into the server using the service provider (Linode)'s console. So I checked through everything I could think of. Has taken a long time. It looked like the problem was with Linode's connections. So just I went to their support page to ask them to check. There was a ticket in my inbox there, "Suspected Botnet Activity" - they've blocked normal net access. Bollocks! 
Silly me, I should have checked there first.
So I've a load more admin to do to clean it before they'll open it again. I went through the exact same thing not long ago, made notes, so should be much quicker this time (& better - there were a couple of additional things I should probably have done, now paying the price). At least I know what the problem is now. But very very boring admin to do.
