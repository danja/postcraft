Securing a bare Ubuntu server involves several crucial steps to protect it from unauthorized access and ensure its integrity. Here's a systematic approach:

### 1. **Update Your System**
- **Command:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- This ensures all the installed packages are up to date with the latest security patches.

### 2. **Create a New User with Sudo Privileges**
- Avoid using the `root` account. Create a new user with `sudo` privileges for administrative tasks.
- **Commands:**
  - `adduser username`
  - `usermod -aG sudo username`

### 3. **Set Up SSH Key Authentication**
- SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging into a server than using passwords alone.
- **On your local machine**, generate a new SSH key pair with `ssh-keygen`.
- **Copy the public key to your server** using `ssh-copy-id username@your_server_ip`.

### 4. **Disable Root Login and Password Authentication**
- Edit the SSH configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
- Set `PermitRootLogin no` to disable root login.
- Set `PasswordAuthentication no` to force SSH key authentication.
- **Restart SSH:** `sudo systemctl restart sshd`.

### 5. **Set Up a Basic Firewall**
- Ubuntu uses `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) for managing firewall rules.
- **Commands:**
  - Enable SSH connections: `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH`
  - Enable the firewall: `sudo ufw enable`
- **Optional:** Allow specific ports/services as needed, e.g., HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443).

### 6. **Configure Fail2Ban**
- Fail2Ban scans log files for multiple failed login attempts and temporarily bans IPs.
- **Installation:** `sudo apt install fail2ban`
- **Configuration:** Copy the default configuration file (`/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`) to a local file (`/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`) and adjust as necessary.

### 7. **Keep Time with NTP**
- Ensuring your server's clock is accurate is important for security logs and time-based authentication protocols.
- **Command:** `sudo apt install ntp`

### 8. **Secure Shared Memory**
- Edit `/etc/fstab` to add `tmpfs /run/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0`.
- This step helps prevent certain types of attacks involving shared memory.

### 9. **Regularly Apply Security Updates**
- Consider configuring unattended upgrades to automatically apply security updates.
- **Installation:** `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`
- **Configure:** Edit `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` to suit your preferences.

### 10. **Audit Your System**
- Use tools like Lynis (a security auditing tool) to analyze your system for potential security issues.
- **Installation:** `sudo apt install lynis`
- **Usage:** `sudo lynis audit system`

### Follow Best Practices
- **Least Privilege:** Only give the minimum necessary permissions to users and services.
- **Regular Backups:** Ensure you have a backup strategy for your server data and configurations.
- **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity.

This checklist is a starting point. Security is an ongoing process and needs to be adapted as new vulnerabilities are discovered and as the server's roles and services evolve.
