I have some BIG news.

I’ve spent the last six years procrastinating about setting up my own company. My dream,  for a long time has been to be my own boss and make my own decisions. Risk aversion, self-confidence and personal circumstances have prevented me from doing so. I’ve got an itch I need to scratch in my life and if the last few years have taught me anything, it is that life is too short not to follow your dreams & ambitions when you can. 

On this basis:

- Four weeks ago, just before I went to Dubai, I set up a limited  company (thank you Steve!) 
- I’ve spent time in between doing admin and building a business strategy, making some initial strategic investments and lining up a clear plan and a considerable portfolio of opportunities through my network and connections 
- I’ve lined-up conversations with some potential strategic partners 
- Today, I handed in my notice at my employer, where I’ve held a senior position as CISO for over three years

I’m feeling somewhat overwhelmed at this decision and getting through today has been very hard, but I know I can do it. With amazing support from Julia and the girls  all the way I’m giving up on the stability of full-time employment with an established business and taking on the world by myself.

I’m leaving behind two exceptional people in my team who I love professionally and as friends and who I’ll miss considerably and if/when in time I can bring them in to my new ventures, I will. 

There is a long and scary road ahead but if I don’t do it now whilst I’m young(ish),healthy, passionate and motivated, I never will. Also, as a father I want to demonstrate to my girls that  their Daddy isn’t  scared to follow his dreams, even at 46 and I’ll hopefully make them all proud.

Jules has kindly & generously bought and gifted  me a sparkling new Mac for the business, which shows how dedicated my amazing family are in supporting me with this life-changing decision. 

My new business is called JandaSec Ltd, you can find me on Companies House. JANDA is my  handle and stands for “Jules AND Andy”; obviously Sec is short for Security.

I have placeholder website in place here https://jandasec.com/ which I’ll develop over the coming months. You’ll also see me adding more content around Cyber Security in-time, there is a LOT I have planned!

- Fractional/Virtual CISO services including Security NED support, particularly in the PE space where companies require attention in advance of acquisition events
- Cyber Security Master Classes for SME companies & professionals who don’t have budget for a full-time CISO or even a V-CISO
- A exceptionally low-priced, master class for schools, teachers and parents addressing cybersecurity, security hygiene and how we can empower our children to be safe online, especially with apps like Snapchat and TikTok. 
- Probably other stuff too as things take off and I can start to build a team

I will also be selling some of these products and services through Facebook and LinkedIn so my apologies in advance if you see content from me which isn’t relevant to you!  

Exciting (and terrifying) times!!!
