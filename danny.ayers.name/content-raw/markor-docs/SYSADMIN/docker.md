It seems like you're having issues with running LibreChat with Docker Compose as a systemd service. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check the systemd service file**: Ensure that the systemd service file is correctly configured. The `ExecStart` directive should point to your `docker-compose` command. For example:

    ```
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /path/to/your/docker-compose.yml up
    ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /path/to/your/docker-compose.yml down
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/docker-compose.yml` with the correct path to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Check Docker Compose file**: Ensure that your Docker Compose file is properly formatted and doesn't contain any errors. You can use the `docker-compose config` command to verify that it is valid.

3. **Check for permissions issues**: Make sure that the user under which the systemd service is running has sufficient permissions to run Docker commands. You can specify the user with the `User` directive in the systemd service file.

4. **Check the logs**: Even though you mentioned that there are no obvious errors in the logs, it would be beneficial to double-check. You can use the `journalctl` command to check the logs for your systemd service. For example, `journalctl -u your-service-name` would show the logs for your service.

5. **Check Docker status**: Make sure Docker is running before the systemd service starts. You can set Docker as a dependency in the systemd service file with the `After=docker.service` directive.

If you have already checked these and the issue persists, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about your setup and any specific error messages you're encountering.
