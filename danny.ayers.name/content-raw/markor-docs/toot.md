I just lost about 500 words because I hit the count here, backtracked to try and chunk.
Very bad UX. For fuck's sake. 
Twitter was innovative, 20 years ago, the idea of 140 chars only was brilliant. But it became obvious that having that as The Law didn't quite work. So double chars, now merry Elon's pay-for extension. I repeat, for FFS.
How fucking imagination does it take, like of the the top of my head is 10 fucking seconds. Ok, short messages are one thing, longer ones are another. As modalities go, that is not a fucking great leap. 
10 seconds more - I wish to subscribe to danja's 140 char messages, but not his 1,400,000 char essays. For fuck's sake again. The Fediverse is fucked if it can't deal with rerouting on a fucking string length.
Sorry, mostly annoyed with myself for not writing things in my own space first, only post elsewhere with filters. But also annoyed, FFS, losing shit in 2024, grr
