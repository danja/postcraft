Nicolas Fodor I'll take a position somewhere in between yours and David's. His point re. probabilistic search is technically true, but then that seems like how a lot of information processing in animal cognion works. In human terms I'll call the current LLMs etc gifted 6 year olds. They have incredible knowledge (and by extension, skill sets). They have the enthusiasm of a child, but also get distracted, make stupid mistakes, make things up. A key aspect I reckon right now lies around agency. Strictly speaking , the models don't have it. Out of the box they lack autonomy and motivation to act. But that seems such a trivial thing. We know how to pump information around. It's straightforward to make the receiver (or transmitter) a chatbot or whatever. I don't think a single model will offer much, but wire a few together as a community and prompt with language including a verb or two, and I reckon we're off.
