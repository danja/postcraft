Your task is to compare the speculations of early pioneers of human-computer interaction with the current state of the art to find avenues that haven't been explored. This task will be carried out in four distinct steps. 
Step one, find and read material online such as
 "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush, "Field Guide to Augmenting Human Intellect" by Doug Engelbart and relevant thoughts of Ted Nelson.
Internally combine your findings in a form which will capture key ideas from each of these, and save that.
Step two, apply the same process as step one to material about AI, Deep Learning and Large Language Models.
Step three, compare the results of the previous step to find any early ideas that haven't yet been fulfilled. Also add any related, unimplemented ideas that are suggested in this comparison. 
Step four, summarise this in a short document and display it.
Until the final step the only output given should be very short statements of current progress.
