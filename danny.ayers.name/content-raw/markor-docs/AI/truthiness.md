There are several categorization systems and methodologies developed by media watchdogs, researchers, and journalism organizations to evaluate the quality of news stories. While there isn't a universally accepted scale that ranges from completely fabricated stories to those with irrefutable documentary evidence, there are a few notable frameworks and guidelines that are widely recognized and used:

1. **Fact-Checking Organizations**: Groups like PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org use their own rating systems to assess the accuracy of specific claims or stories. These often include labels like "True," "Mostly True," "Half True," "Mostly False," "False," and "Pants on Fire."

2. **Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC)**: MBFC is known for its detailed analysis of news sources, categorizing them based on bias (from extreme left to extreme right) and reliability. They use a scale that includes "Least Biased," "Left-Center Bias," "Right-Center Bias," "Pro-Science," "Conspiracy-Pseudoscience," and "Questionable Sources," among others.

3. **NewsGuard**: This tool provides trust ratings for news and information sites. It uses a color-coded system (green, yellow, red) along with a numerical score out of 100, based on nine journalistic criteria, including credibility and transparency.

4. **The Trust Project**: This initiative works with news organizations to develop transparency standards that help readers assess the quality of journalism. News stories from participating organizations are evaluated based on various indicators like "Best Practices," "Author/Reporter Expertise," "Type of Work," "Citations and References," etc.

5. **The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN)**: The IFCN doesn't provide a direct rating system for news stories, but it does set standards for organizations that want to be certified as fact-checkers. Certified organizations are expected to adhere to principles like fairness, transparency, and nonpartisanship.

6. **The CRAAP Test**: Originally developed for evaluating research sources, the CRAAP Test (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose) is a checklist that can be applied to news stories to assess their quality.

These systems focus on various aspects like the factual accuracy of content, the bias of the source, the transparency of the organization, and the journalistic process used in creating the content. While they provide valuable guidelines and frameworks, it's important to remember that the evaluation of news quality can be subjective and complex, and these systems are not foolproof.
