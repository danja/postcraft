Here is the summary of the comparison between the early ideas in human-computer interaction and the current state of AI and large language models to identify unexplored avenues:

Vannevar Bush's memex concept envisioned a collective memory machine to manage the information explosion, a precursor to the internet and hypertext [➊](https://archive.org/details/as-we-may-think). Engelbart's work aimed at augmenting human intellect and outlined a systematic approach to improve human effectiveness [➋](https://archive.org/details/1962-engelbart-AHI-framework). Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu sought to create a computer network with a simple user interface for a universal repository for global knowledge [➌](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson).

The current state of AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), shows rapid advancement in understanding and generating text using deep learning on massive datasets [➍](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/10/10/llms-ai-horizon/) [➎](https://www.techtarget.com/WhatIs/feature/12-of-the-best-large-language-models). Models like GPT-3 demonstrate surprising capabilities that go beyond simple text prediction to activities like coding, composing music, and even contributing to drug discovery [➏](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-large-language-models-will-transform-science-society-and-ai#:~:text=In%20July%202020%2C%20OpenAI%20unveiled,the%20ability%20to%20write).

Comparing the two, the early vision of a highly interconnected knowledge system with easy user interface (Project Xanadu) and the ability to augment human intellect (Engelbart's vision) align with the current abilities of LLMs. However, there seems to be a gap in realizing a fully integrated system that not only stores knowledge but also facilitates the connection of ideas in a manner that truly augments human cognition.

Unexplored avenues may include:
- Systems that enhance cognitive connections between disparate pieces of information, similar to Bush's idea of associative trails in the memex.
- More intuitive and seamless interfaces for interacting with AI, inspired by Nelson's vision of simplicity in Project Xanadu.
- Applications that extend LLM capabilities to broader domains of knowledge management, potentially fulfilling Engelbart's augmenting human intellect on a societal scale.

The current trajectory of AI and LLMs shows promise in reaching these unexplored areas, with the potential to fulfill and exceed the early HCI pioneers' visions.
