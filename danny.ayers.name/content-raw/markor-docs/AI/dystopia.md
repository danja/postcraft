 Sure, here are a couple of original sci-fi scenarios I invented to help illustrate the differences between utopian and dystopian:

Utopian: 

The planet Minerva is home to an advanced civilization focused on sustainability and equality. Its cities are powered by renewable energy and its people live freely and comfortably supported by generous social programs. The population stays small as a matter of cultural choice and great care is taken to ensure nature continues to flourish on the planet. Technology, art, culture, and the culinary arts are pursued with vigor, and there is little conflict as crime and war are almost nonexistent. The citizens of Minerva value cooperation and thrive by working towards common goals. 

Dystopian:  

The survivors aboard starship Exodus fled a dying Earth over 500 years ago looking for a new home. Though they finally reached the promising planet of Terra Nova, a brutal civil war breaks out between factions who disagree on how to govern this new world. Dictatorial Admirals seize power and establish a military state that severely restricts freedoms and comforts for “less valuable” civilians. Wealth, status and opportunity become concentrated among the Admirals and their supporters. A privileged few live in luxury aboard vast city-ships orbiting the planet, while impoverished workers toil in crowded underground colonies struggling to terraform the still mostly inhospitable world below.  

Let me know if these original examples help illustrate the contrast and if you need any clarification or have additional creative suggestions for me. I tried to paint two very different visions of how an advanced fictional society could function given different ideologies and circumstances.
