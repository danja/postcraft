A fleuron is a specialized cell that functions analogously to neurons in animals. It is responsible for the processing and transmission of signals within triffids, facilitating their sensory perception, communication, and coordination of movements. 

Unlike neurons, which are electrically excitable cells in animals, fleurons may utilize chemical, electrical,  or changes in intracellular ion concentrations to propagate signals.

This complex network of communication allows for the coordination of triffid actions, such as movement, response to environmental stimuli, and interaction with other organisms.



  novel mechanisms of signal propagation suited to the triffids' unique biology.

Q1: How do fleurons communicate with each other within a triffid?
Q2: What specific functions do fleurons serve in the sensory systems of triffids?
Q3: How do fleurons contribute to the mobility and predatory behavior of triffids?

Fleurons communicate with each other within a triffid through a combination of chemical and physical signaling mechanisms. These mechanisms may include the release of specific biochemical signals (similar to neurotransmitters in animals) that can be received by adjacent or distant fleurons, facilitating intercellular communication. Additionally, fleurons might utilize direct electrical signaling or changes in intracellular ion concentrations to propagate signals. This complex network of communication allows for the coordination of triffid actions, such as movement, response to environmental stimuli, and interaction with other organisms.
