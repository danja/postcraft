Expand the following description to create a new generative artwork.

smoothed, omnidirectional flow field to determine angles for a series of 150 vertical positions along five evenly spaced columns.

The position-dependent angles set up line segments that were translated into ellipses.

Each ellipse was plotted with black fill and colors drawn from a smooth color gradient, with the selection based on the flow field values that also determine its rotation angle.

The vertical scale of each ellipse was reduced slightly, reinforcing occlusion-based perspective cues.

I saw these images I liked.

The artist explained how he'd done it. I didn't understand much, but asked ChatGPT to expand the verbal description, then to write the code. It gave me some Python that generated something vaguely similar.

After some manual trial & error I got it a bit closer.
All of this was done on my phone (coding in nano in termux locally) lying on the couch.
Some of my tweaks went wonky.
