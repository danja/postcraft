The current state of knowledge bases in AI is characterized by the integration of artificial intelligence, ontology development, semantic search, and automated machine learning to enhance information organization and retrieval [➊](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00287-022-01513-9#:~:text=In%20this%20article%2C%20selected%20new,the%20weaknesses%20of%20the) [➋](https://capacity.com/learn/knowledge-base/knowledge-base-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=Knowledge%20base%20AI%20can%20be,optimize%20traditional%20knowledge%20bases). AI-driven knowledge base tools are transforming these databases into more efficient and user-friendly resources, providing streamlined access to vast, organized collections of information [➌](https://www.helpscout.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base/#:~:text=Here%20are%20a%20few%20AI,on%20improving%20search%20accuracy) [➍](https://www.liveagent.com/blog/ai-knowledge-base/#:~:text=An%20AI%20knowledge%20base%20is,find%20the%20information%20it%20needs).

Semantic web and linked data technologies aim to make the web more intelligent and interoperable, with a focus on standardized formats for machine-readable data [➎](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-current-trends-future-directions-semantic-web-linked#:~:text=The%20semantic%20web%20and%20linked,using%20standardized%20formats%20and) [➏](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358954709_CURRENT_STATE_OF_SEMANTIC_WEB_TECHNOLOGIES#:~:text=And%20to%20make%20use%2C%20and,comes). They enable the linking of data sets across different sources, facilitating machine-to-machine communication and better query results [➐](https://pitt.libguides.com/metadatadiscovery/linked-data#:~:text=Linked%20data%20is%20the%20basis,can%20draw%20relationships%20between%20resources) [➑](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/semantic-web#:~:text=The%20Semantic%20Web%20encompasses%20the,the%20use%20of%20Linked%20Data).

Combining these findings with the previous ones, it's evident that while AI and large language models have advanced significantly in understanding and generating human language, there's room for growth in integrating these capabilities with the semantic web and knowledge bases. The unexplored avenues could include:

- Developing AI systems that can understand and generate not just text but also structured semantic web data, thus bridging the gap between unstructured language and structured data.
- Enhancing large language models to improve the interlinking of knowledge bases, allowing for a more intuitive exploration of connected ideas, similar to Engelbart's vision of augmenting human intellect.
- Creating more user-friendly interfaces that leverage the power of both AI and semantic web technologies to facilitate the connection of ideas and knowledge in a way that's accessible to a broader audience, drawing on Ted Nelson's emphasis on simple user interfaces.

By pursuing these areas, researchers could unlock new methods of knowledge discovery and creation, providing tools that enhance human intelligence and creativity in line with the pioneering visions of Bush, Engelbart, and Nelson.
