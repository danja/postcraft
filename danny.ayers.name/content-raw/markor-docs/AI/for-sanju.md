Another great session! Congratulations on assembling an exceptionally good set of presenters.

Sorry to repeat myself, but it would be good (of course if creators were ok with it) to get the slide decks online. Material this quality is good promotion for everyone involved. 
But also, speaking as a student : it's wonderful information there and then, I've learnt a lot at the time. But so much in a short period, many things to explore after.

And I'll repeat this : anything I might be able to help you with, let me now. (I wasn't in a great frame of mind around the time of the previous thing, but now some personal problems resolved.). Around the conference side of things - I've seen how that works, ended up chairing a couple of things. But also with your students, anyone I might be able to encourage in some way. 
Absolutely with informal paper-reviewing & proof-reading, translation even. Too often when I've been on programme committees I've seen a paper I think has a lot of merit, but others have voted it out. Only reason being less-than-perfect English - which is just wrong when it isn't the author's first language.
