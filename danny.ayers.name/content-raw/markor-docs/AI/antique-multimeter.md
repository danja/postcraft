During the night I was in a huge 2nd hand bookshop in Buxton. I was tempted to buy a small 19th century multimeter. It was closest to the one with the 3 probes, but with a small LCD display.

  Â£20 seemed too much at the time, but I'm thinking I should go back tonight and get it. Worth it?

Please create an image of a very small 18th century voltmeter. It will be circular with green enamelled body and thin gold trim around the edges, ornamented rather like a  Faberge egg but flat-faced, with a few tiny rubies. It will have a short probe. It with be slightly scuffed and have an antique patina.

Please create an image of multimeter with a pair of connected probes in the style of porcelain from the palace of Versailles
