Delphi method

I want to have a play around smallish language models, bypass LLM+RAG by kinda hardwiring bits. RDF-ish structures, HTTP/procedural-ish paths. Baby steps, I thought little training dataset with plenty of wordiness, bit of graph structure. Grab 1,000 topic-specific papers from ArXiv, pdf2txt, NLP-parse out the refs, duckduckgo for links, get another say 5,000 papers.

Question -> who would be best to ask -> their published world, possibly even direct contact -> ask there -> answer

First examine the constructed language toki pona in terms of its potential for rhyming lyrics, compared to English and Italian. Give me a very short summary. Then, after searching online as necessary, analyse and extract the lyric structure of the songs "I Marziani" by Peppino Di Capri and "Martian Hop" by the Ran-Dells. Give me a very short summary. Then make a synthesis of these as a parallel in toki pona and show me the result. Finally, translate that in a literal manner to English, and show me the result.

btw, I really like playing at cover songs. An original with something I like on a sort of emotional level, which puts a lot of old cheese in the frame. But even if I start trying to recreate something very similar, it's impossible not to diverge. Like painting by numbers but you also get to move the lines around. I expect there's interesting space around AI taking a similar approach. I just noticed this thing in my lyrics folder, never did anything with it. Listening to it again, first thought is if everything were the same but for the rhythm section replaced with Peter Hook & Stephen Morris.
