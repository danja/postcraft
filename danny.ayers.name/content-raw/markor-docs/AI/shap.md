SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a method used to interpret machine learning model outputs. It calculates the contribution of each feature to a prediction. SHAP is grounded in game theory's Shapley values, which distribute credit among contributors in a cooperative setting. This method is applicable to various types of models, with variants like KernelSHAP and TreeSHAP. Besides offering explanations, SHAP helps in visualizing these interpretations and assessing the importance of different features [âžŠ](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). 

For practical uses, SHAP is valuable in fields where understanding the decision-making process of AI is crucial. This includes healthcare for diagnostic decisions, finance for credit scoring, and any domain where transparency in AI decision-making enhances trust and effectiveness.
