"Saturday, sun was out so I walked up to the bar to have a beer and finish reading Vince's Neural Circuit Diagrams paper. But remembered he'd tweeted a link to stuff about scary Category Theory stuff. Searching, first hit was a piece on such diagrams from neurology. My brain hurts already."

Sat arvo, sun's blazin' so I strolled to the pub for a frothy & to wrap me head around  @vtabbott_'s AI wiring scribbles. Then clocked he'd slung a tweet 'bout some bonkers Category Theory biz. First squiz online, bang! A yarn on those squiggles from real brain science. Me noggin's fried.
