Note to self, I need to discuss this with ChatGPT4 some time, but might as well poke your rear brain as well. 
The question is, what problems are we trying to solve?
Ok, I know for me it's a non-starter having the big human problems on my list, the scale blocks my engagement. The meta-problem is how to solve problems, but that demands problems to be solved. One is easy to identify for myself : top being gettting a living income.
That exposes the problem I (we all) have with getting things done (efficiently). Which gives me an umbrella for all my other stuff. Tools for the GTD is root node. Other things (like the earthquake stuff, hobbies etc) all dangle from there.
I really like "Connolly's Bane" as Graham Klyne called it : "The bane of my existence is doing things I know the computer could do for me."
(Wonder what Graham's up to these days).
