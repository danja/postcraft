You may have noticed : Mistral now have a free tier. I've  only skimmed but it looks like it'll be really useful : has chat, API and agents (appear to be model + system prompt, with temperature control). Among their models are coding & images, not sure what you get for free.

They also have pay-for fine-tuning facilities. I've a few RDF//LLM crossover ideas I want to try out, but was lacking a convenient setup.
"Every fine-tuning job comes with a minimum fee of $4, and there's a monthly storage fee of $2 for each model."
