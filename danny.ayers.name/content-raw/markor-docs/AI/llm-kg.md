Through extensive research, I have compiled information from various sources that can guide the encoding of graph-shaped data for prompts in GPT-4, as well as methods for prompts that return such data. Here's a synthesis of the best practices and methodologies derived from the sources:

1. **Understanding Graph Encoding for LLMs**: Research shows that graph encoding methods, the nature of the graph task, and the graph's structure itself can all significantly impact an LLM’s performance on graph reasoning tasks. Different encoding techniques can boost performance by a substantial margin, depending on the task at hand [➊](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2310.04560.pdf).

2. **Graph Prompt Engineering and Encoding**: A comprehensive approach involves decomposing the problem into graph encoding and graph prompt engineering. Graph encoding helps understand how an LLM's learned representations are leveraged in graph tasks, while prompt engineering identifies the most suitable way to elicit the desired response from an LLM [➋](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2310.04560.pdf).

3. **Prompting Heuristics**: A variety of prompting heuristics have been proposed, such as zero-shot prompting, few-shot in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, zero-shot CoT prompting, and bag prompting. Each heuristic serves a different purpose and can be chosen based on the requirements of the graph task [➌](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2310.04560.pdf).

4. **Graph-ToolFormer Framework**: A proposed framework known as Graph-ToolFormer aims to empower LLMs with graph reasoning abilities by using prompts augmented by ChatGPT to invoke external graph reasoning API tools. This framework addresses the challenges LLMs face with multi-step logic reasoning, precise mathematical calculation, and spatial and temporal reasoning when dealing with complex graph data [➍](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2304.11116).

5. **Incorporating Graph Data into LLMs**: The ultimate goal of these methods is to integrate graph data into LLMs for various graph reasoning tasks. This integration could potentially help LLMs overcome existing weaknesses when handling graph-structured data and enable complex graph reasoning tasks [➎](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2304.11116).

Based on these insights, to input data with a graph shape and ensure that the output also has the same shape, one could consider:

- **Designing Graph-Structured Prompts**: Using the findings from the GraphQA benchmarks and Graph-ToolFormer framework, design prompts that reflect the graph structure by including nodes and edges in the text.
- **Employing Appropriate Prompting Heuristics**: Depending on the complexity of the graph reasoning task, select a prompting heuristic that can support graph-shaped input and output, such as chain-of-thought prompting for stepwise reasoning or bag prompting for tasks that require understanding the graph structure.
- **Using External APIs**: When necessary, augment prompts to utilize external APIs that can process and return graph-structured data, as suggested by the Graph-ToolFormer framework.  This could involve providing instructions within the prompt for the LLM to format the output in a way that external tools can process it into a graph-shaped structure.

Implementing these strategies should help in encoding graph-shaped data for use in prompts and receiving output in a similar structure. This approach leverages the strengths of LLMs while compensating for their limitations in handling graph-structured information.
