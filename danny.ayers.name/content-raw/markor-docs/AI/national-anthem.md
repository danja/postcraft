Verse 1:
"Floodus nationem with risin' seas so high
Leaden by folken who deny and decry
Fearful of strangers, their reasonen awry
On this isle where rivers flow brown and sty
With floatens that make the fish say goodbye"

Verse 2:
"Oh! Confus√®d rulen of our warming land,
We watchem your choices, hard to understand
Declaren to all, both native and offhand,
That your policies oft on shaky ground stand,
At least so the scientans would reprimand,
Had they been hearden 'bove fearful addresses
At least so the futurens all assesses,
For the more we our minds to change do yield,
The better our worlden might be healed"
