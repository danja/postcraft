This 'Grantchester' TV mystery, set in 1950s Cambridgeshire, featured a West Indian archdeacon. It seemed very anachronistic...but I hadn't a clue. 

Time for Google. 
Nearest relevant thing I could find was that the first black bishop in the UK, Wilfred Denniston Wood, was appointed in 1985.

Time for ChatGPT.
"The first black archdeacon in the UK was John Anthony Francis Wilkinson, known as Bill Wilkinson. He was appointed as the Archdeacon of Durham in 1987..."

Bishop sits over archdeacon, no..? 
Back to Google. 
Not a trace of John Anthony Francis Wilkinson.
But apparently there has been a notable Bill Wilkinson, he was 'Imperial Wizard, Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan', 1975â€“1981.
