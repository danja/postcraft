The snake you saw in Tuscany is likely the European grass snake (Natrix natrix), also known as the ringed snake. This species is commonly found in various parts of Europe, including Italy. Here are some key identifying features:

1. **Length**: Typically, they can grow much longer, but juveniles and smaller individuals might match the 40 cm length you observed.
2. **Coloration**: The European grass snake often has a series of yellow and black stripes running along its body, which fits your description.
3. **Behavior**: These snakes are usually found near water bodies like ponds, rivers, or marshes.

Here are follow-up questions to further narrow down the identification or to learn more about similar species:

Q1: Were there any specific patterns on the snake's head, such as a distinctive collar or markings?

Q2: Did the snake exhibit any specific behaviors, such as swimming or a particular way of moving?

Q3: Were you able to observe the environment in which the snake was found, such as proximity to water or type of vegetation?

Claude Sonnet 3.5 :
 Based on your description, it sounds like you may have encountered a Western Whip Snake (Hierophis viridiflavus), also known as the European Whip Snake. Here are some details that match your observation:

1. Size: These snakes can grow up to 150 cm, but juveniles and younger adults often measure around 40-60 cm, fitting your observed length.

2. Body shape: They are known for their slim, elongated bodies.

3. Coloration: While adults are typically green and yellow (hence the Latin name "viridiflavus"), juveniles and some adults can have a pattern of yellow and black stripes running along their body.

4. Location: This species is common in Italy, including Tuscany.

5. Behavior: They are diurnal (active during the day) and often seen basking in the sun or moving through vegetation.

It's important to note that snake identification can be tricky, especially without a clear photo. The Western Whip Snake is non-venomous and generally harmless to humans, but it's always best to observe snakes from a safe distance.

Would you like more information about this species or other snakes found in Tuscany?
