Carlos:
Well, superintelligence is more difficult because we don't yet have the artificial fluent systems that can invent new abstractions.  We only have the kind that mimics them.  None of these systems can think out of the box!

I partly disagree, but the terms in this space are so floppy. I like superintelligence = ability to invent new abstractions, but 'abstraction' also needs pinning down. I probably agree, I don't think we're there yet.

There is a clear distinction between mimicry & invention,
->
but I don't think it's a hard barrier, already passed. Consider a procedure like this against a current LLM :
* Pick two devices at random : LLM says mousetrap; pop-up toaster
* Combine their features, merging similar ones : bread inside = bait; pop-up = death spring
* Describe the result in terms of the original functionalites : a device that catches & cooks your breakfast.

Is this invention? Recombining well-known things to make something new is pretty common in the real world.
