I just watched the Neural circuit diagrams vid. I'm not really any the wiser. But I reckon it'll be worth spending time with these. I didn't understand a thing about Attention from the paper. Opaque text & maths, rubbish diagram. I only got some idea about it from watching more than one *long* video (and struggling to keep focus). The practical code tends to hide all the internals. Ie. none of these representations suited me. But these diagrams seem to be at a really good Lego level of abstraction.
Neural circuit diagrams paper is still sitting on the printer...
