I will upload a photo of a dog. Please create a very detailed description of the dog. Do not tell me the description. Then generate a painting of the dog described together with a guitar and a clarinet in a cubist style, taking note of the following elements:
- **Geometric Forms**: Objects and figures are broken down into geometric shapes, such as cubes, rectangles, and triangles.
- **Fragmented Perspective**: Multiple viewpoints are presented simultaneously. A single image may show the front, side, and back of a subject.
- **Abstract Representation**: cubist work often moves away from traditional, realistic representations, opting instead for abstraction.
- **Bold Color Use**:  later cubist works incorporated a vibrant palette, follow this 
- **Expressive Line Work**: cubist paintings often feature expressive, fluid lines that add dynamism to his compositions.
Make it a masterpiece of modern art that will make the dog's friend's proud.
