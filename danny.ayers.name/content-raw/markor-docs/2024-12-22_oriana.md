Sorry, I'm only now catching up with messages. Azzurra does seem keen to move in as soon as possible, but I don't think there's any great urgency. When I spoke with her on Friday she said she was going to call the comune to get an appointment to sort out her residence docs for the electricity. I've still got several little jobs I need to do over there. 

I only just saw a message from Michele saying he could pick up the the fridge today. Ops, my bad, I was too late, so not today. But I don't need to go anywhere (apart from shopping) in the foreseeable future, so I told him he could pick up the fridge whenever he likes.
