Claudio Etc.
There are two little black electric heaters around (the switches don’t work on one, you just have to use the plug). Plug one or both in as soon as you arrive. Light a fire if you fancy reading a book or whatever. 
The main thing Claudio will need is company (and food). Please give him lots of love.

Unless you think he really needs a walk, don’t bother. A week without isn’t a big deal, I’ll make it up to him when I get back. I’m much more worried about him escaping. He doesn’t understand traffic, there are the lunatic Mozzanella drivers.
If you (or Nino) do take him out, put his bright jacket on (kitchen door). Don’t use the extending lead : it’s not his strength that’s the problem, it’s when he runs unexpectedly and reaches the end of the lead with a sudden force. I find it really hard to keep hold sometimes and I’m used to it. There’s a rope lead on the door as well – use that, keep him close, no surprises. Keep your teeth.

Food 
His bowl is usually under the kitchen table. Croccantini are in a bin at the end of the balcony. Three of my handfuls, but maybe give him a little bit more, he’ll just leave it for later if there’s too much.

One tin of pate, kitchen cupboard. 

I usually give him one or two biscuits or whatever treats through the day. The thin stick treats are for Zampa Game.

Last thing, a Denti Stix.

There’s a water bucket under the kitchen table, a pan in the bidet.

Poo
He will poop in the office. But unless you’re feeling brave, just leave it, I’ll do it when I get back (there are scooping tools in the yard, white bucket). I already need to give that floor a really good scrub but have been putting it off. A lot of the varnish has worn off, so when I do next get it properly clean I want to give it a coat of linseed oil.

Fridge
Probably best if you take everything that’s in the fridge and unplug it. I think it might need defrosting again anyway.

Water
It’s very low pressure because I’ve switched the pump off. When I last did washing it didn’t switch off properly. It probably dislodged something, caused a little drip. I’ll fix it when I get back.
