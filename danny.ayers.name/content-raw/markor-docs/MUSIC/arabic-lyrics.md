0:14 I have eyelids. The structure of these eyelids has given me away

0:20 Talani Al-Bunyan is an American. The club is not where I am

0:25 Where are the pink cheeks and teeth, my dear?

0:30 Al-Baraa, where am I? It's dangerous, my father

0:35 My heart beats even if my mourner has stopped

0:42 [Music]

0:52 Your heart is as dark as kohl, my father, I am murdered

0:57 The killers, my father, I am the heart, no matter how long a dead person lives

1:02 In the shrouds is a heart, no matter how long it lives, it is killed in the shrouds

1:07 No, where am I? No, where am I?
