Despite all the music nerds geeking out over it, and despite it looking so incredibly sophisticated, "negative harmony" has very limited uses.

And it's really much simpler than you might think - what it really is is just "chromatic inversion, and then respell the chords to different roots".

The result of this transformation has a few key properties:

- **All the voice leadings are still intact, just in the opposite direction.** A leading tone is still a leading tone, a leap is still a leap, a step is still a step, a repetition is still a repetition - only anything that went up now goes down, and vv.
- **Chord qualities are changed, but chord stability stays intact.** Stable chords like major and minor triads are still stable, and unstable chords like diminished chords are still unstable. That's because while the directions of all intervals have been flipped, their sizes are still the same, so a chord that had a major third and a minor third will still have a major third and a minor third.
- **Chord roots are all over the place.** That's because we have redesignated those roots in order to make "stack-of-thirds" chords again, and since we've inverted all the intervals, this will move the chord root from the former bottom of the stack to the former top, which, after flipping, is now the bottom. And because the top is the highest chord extension, some relatively inconsequential changes to the chord quality (like, say, adding a #11 or a 13) completely change the character of the inverted chord. For example, C, Cmaj7, Cmaj9, Cmaj13 are all functionally the same, but if we chromatically invert them about C, we get Fm, Dbmaj7, Bbm9, and Ebsus13 (Eb, Bb, Db, F, Ab, C). Those are 4 completely different roots, and the resulting root line in a chord progression employing such inverted extended chords is not going to resemble the original root line at all.

So that pretty accurately describes the effect you'll get: chord progressions and melodies that sound consistent and sensible due to all the voice leadings and chord stabilities remaining intact, but with seemingly random root movements and chord progressions. If that's the effect you want, then negative harmony is the recipe to use.

You can also take it a step further and retain the original melody while still getting negative harmony weirdness. The trick for that is to chromatically invert the melody, harmonize that inversion normally, and then invert the whole thing back. Now you get a regular melody, but with weirdified chords.

Example:

- Take "Row Your Boat", C C C D E, E D E F G.
- Chromatically invert about C: C C C Bb Ab, Ab Bb Ab G F.
- Harmonize: Fm Eb13 Ab / , Bbm7 [Fm/C C7] Fm /
- Chromatically invert about C: C Bø7(b9) Am / , Em7 [C/D Dø7] C.
- Add original melody back

The chords still fit the melody, but they are now utterly weird and seemingly make no sense.
