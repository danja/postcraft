You can do it all with one ReaComp on the bass track!

I'll explain how to set up a simple ducking Sidechain effect for you:

Firstly, take a send from your kick drum and route it to your bass track. ([This can be done by clicking & dragging something like this](https://imgur.com/a/aNyfoF0)). Make sure you load up ReaComp on the bass track.

Now you should see the send appear [on the kick track.](https://imgur.com/a/fXhmNdZ).

A 'routing controls' window should appear automatically. If not, click on the send and the window will appear, where you can choose to send the output to [Auxiliary Channels on the Bass track](https://imgur.com/a/j0cirKe). Select *3/4* (sometimes this is in the further drop down "New channels on receiving track")

Now, back to your bass track, open up your ReaComp and [select "auxiliary inputs" on the detector input drop-down menu](https://imgur.com/a/mZuixSQ). This makes the compressor listen & react to the other track that being sent to it, yet apply the compression to the primary signal.

Now when you play your full track, you should see ReaComp on the bass track being triggered silently by the kick. Pull down the threshold. If you've done everything right, you should hear your bass track start to duck with every kick. Now you can adjust threshold, attack/release times & ratio to taste.

Once you get used to how it all works, you can start experimenting with different sidechain-enabled compressors with different feels and compressors. At the moment I'm loving vibe of Native Instruments' VC-2A as a Sidechain compressor. However, I've been using Reaper for 9 or 10 years now and I still love ReaComp for it's lightweight simplicity.
