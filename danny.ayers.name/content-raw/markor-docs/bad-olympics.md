I just made myself giggle loudly with things I wrote on Twitter. I know if I repeat it here I will giggle again.
A few days ago, not sure quite how, I wound up engaging with a sporty terf lady, @AbsMcFabs on Twitter.

It was about Khalif, the Algerian boxer who's sex was brought into doubt. This lady was spouting what I consider nastiness. I looked at her posts. Unlike JK Rowling, not a complete Victorian reactionary throwback comical weird woman who must have had more that one experimental relationship go very wrong, wrong, wrong shit-for-brains. Strong hints of anti-trans bigotry, but she was was doing things like quoting Germaine Greer, and she was an athlete, so ok. I'll listen.
Her underlying argument was that it wasn't fair for people (including women) with male characteristics ("men", in her unjustified sense) to play in women's games.

Scene set?

Here comes my giggles.

Ok. I thought about this. You know how some weirdos (of a particular Valley ilk) are going for an Olympics where doping etc is encouraged? Win by any means? Physically warped humans, fine.
Go for it. 
Keep going.

Include testosterone-stacked elephants in the weightlifting. Leopards jacked with amphetamines in the 100 metres.
Monkeys with fireworks up their bottoms in the speed climbing.

That's an Olympics I might watch.
