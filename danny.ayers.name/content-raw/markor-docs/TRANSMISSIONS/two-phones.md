Does anyone use 2 Android phones on a regular basis? How?

My latest has developed a connector problem, hopefully fixable on warranty. So I've been reviving the previous. But a lot of apps assume only one will be active, very inconvenient & arbitrary.

Both are fairly basic models : Blackview BV5200 & BV6200. Ruggedized, because I tend to knock them about. Annoyingly they both have an Achilles' Heel with the connector. I got the newer one because charging the old one had gone very intermittent. But I'd had it for a year, so it also felt time for newer model. The new one has only had 7 months and it mostly doesn't want to charge.

They're Android 12 & 13. Not rooted, I daren't risk bricking and Termux supports most of what I'd want anyhow. I'm not religious over it, but I do dislike using proprietary/closed software. The fs restrictions in Android seem more about Google's commercial interests than any real user protection.

In the two+ phone scenario, automatic syncing would be useful in a lot of places. Syncthing is helpful for data, but still a hassle when so much is ringfenced.
I've not had a proper look what's possible with Google Drive, but even having that tied to backup seems exploitative of them. 

I've only done a tiny bit of dev for Android, haven't looked at what you can mess with in Developer Mode. Maybe you could put in a service at a lower layer than typical apps that could provide a path through some of the restrictions..? (But were such a thing possible, I'd probably have heard of it by now).

Another thing I'd clueless about is what's hardwired with SIM cards. I'm guessing access will be limited to the direct phone services, but might it be possible to hook into their interface from a local app, tunnel to that from a remote device, like Phone Two.

This hardware hassle has reminded me how dependent I've got on the pocket computer (I almost never use it as a trade phone). And it's failings.
