Mr. Birds, you still around me 'owd?

I don't spend much time in this place, but I just realised I haven't seen you in a while. 

What brought you to mind - this thing YouTube just put in front of me. Unexpected recommendation, given that I've mostly been playing old dub stuff from there recently.

I do like a bit of the rough old garage stuff. This is a good 'un. Isn't that a Led Zep riff? Mountain something.

Anyroad, at 1 min in, the drummer with a fag in his gob - that's you, you bugger!

You do look very young on this, but 1967, guess you would have been.

Hope all's well with you. Pretty much same-as here.
Don't forget I've still got your Strat (hanging on the workshop wall, stripped down, I'll get around to it before too long...).
