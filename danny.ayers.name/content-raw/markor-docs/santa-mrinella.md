Please create a medieval-style painting filling this description. Devotional Image: Santa Marinella, Protector of Cats and Guardian of Stone Walls, hider of wine.


The saint should be depicted with a gentle, knowing smile, wearing modern eyewear transformed into golden spectacles befitting a medieval icon. Her silver-gray hair should be painted with subtle highlights suggesting a halo effect. The face should show wisdom and kindness through fine lines that speak of a life of joy and contemplation.

Dress her in a slate-gray wool tunic with a deep purple underdress visible at the neck, transformed into rich medieval garments. The tunic should be adorned with subtle golden threaded embellishments along the edges, and secured with wooden buttons that should be painted to look like amber.

Around the figure, create a stone wall background reminiscent of ancient monasteries, but make it appear to glow softly with divine light. 
She is hiding a bottle of wine.
Several cats should be incorporated into the scene:
- three tabby cats sleeping peacefully at her feet
- A grey and white cat perched regally on the wall behind her
- playful gray kittens near her hands
- A fluffy black and white cat with angel-like wings chasing a mouse in the upper corner

Traditional elements to include:
- A golden nimbus (halo) behind her head
- A scroll in her hands with Latin text "Felinus Protector" 
- Small vignettes in the corners showing acts of kindness to animals
- A border of intertwined cats and Celtic knotwork
-  an ornate label, Santa Marinella

The overall color palette should favor warm grays, deep purples, and burnished golds, with touches of sacred blue in the background. The style should mimic the flat perspective of medieval religious paintings while maintaining a warm, approachable expression.
