Hi. I think I heard the kids earlier, but I've been rushing about. I just looked - your tobacco was in the street, I've put it on the doorstep.
I have a flight to the UK on Friday. Provisional plan is to stay about 5 days. I don't think my mother's physical health has suddenly got worse, she just wants me there. But I haven't booked a return flight just in case I do need to stay a little longer.
Terrible timing, I have a lot on at the moment. All rather stressful. So if you happen to be near a supermarket right now, another 5 Peroni would be appreciated :)
(I'll give you the cash)
