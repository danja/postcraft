Would I be right in thinking that you want to move in as soon as possible, like as soon as we get the lights on? I'll message Oriana in a minute about her things. I reckon most should be ok in the cantina there, anything delicate I can bring over here.

I believe Azzurra is wanting to move into the house as soon as possible. The electricity isn't back on yet, so it can't be immediate. But in case you can't collect your things any time soon, I can put some in the cantina there, anything delicate bring over to my house. I can dismantle the bed frame, put it in the cantina. 

In case there's anything that'd be easier to check directly, Oriana's number is 349 506 5105, she has WhatsApp. (She did break her phone recently but I believe that's all ok now)

In case there's anything that'd be easier to check directly, Azzurra's number is 351 575 8178, she has WhatsApp.
