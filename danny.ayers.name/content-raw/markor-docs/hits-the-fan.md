Can we counter nonsense with schoolyard ridicule? Populist politicians and their allies (you know exactly who I have in mind) use mad exaggerated narratives and even blatant lies to great advantage. It may be total rubbish, but they seem immune to the obvious rational response of countering with logic and facts. The only alternative would seem to be playing the same game, but that seems morally questionable, losing the high ground. But maybe schoolboy humour is a reasonable compromise? I'd love to hear your take on this, what other strategies are available, and (for the fun of it) any historical cases you know of where childish PR has been successful. 

Claude, I've tweaked -


"Ok, these certain politicians billionaires get away with crazy narratives and flat-out lies, right? 
When folks counter with facts and logic, it bounces right off them.
We could stoop low and lie right back at these dickheads, but no matter how justified, that still feels wrong.
So what about fighting the BS with playground tactics?
You know, like good old-fashioned mockery? Please let me know what you think. Have you got any fun examples where childish PR actually worked?"
