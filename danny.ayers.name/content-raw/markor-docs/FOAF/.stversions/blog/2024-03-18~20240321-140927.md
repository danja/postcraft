# Progress so far

_After a couple of weeks on this, it only just occurred to write this down. Elsewhere I've got some static site generator code in-progress, main target being a blog from markdown, so I might as well feed it with this._

I'm reasonably familiar with the topic and had a rough idea of what material was out there. So far I've mostly been looking around and planning.

I've got 3 todo lists :

- [todo.md](todo.md) - a provisional list that seems doable in a reasonable amount of time.
- [todo-chatgpt.md](todo-chatgpt.md) - ChatGPT's suggested list, 20 items which I'll use as a reminder to make sure I've covered the essentials.
- [todo-yakshaving.md](todo-yakshaving.md) - I must use existing tools wherever possible, _no yak shaving_ is a requirement. So to avoid temptation, this list is avaiable to dump such thoughts. Also anything that isn't really necessary but would be nice to have.
