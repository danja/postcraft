Hi Kath, Danny in Italy. My mother had ultrasound test this morning, results coming via Bakewell. Marinella the gynae expert here tells me it is something where time might be important. I have access to the NHS app here, but for the security code it sends to my mother's phone. My mother isn't picking up... Don't rush or anything, but if you happen to be nearby in the near future, please call me.
