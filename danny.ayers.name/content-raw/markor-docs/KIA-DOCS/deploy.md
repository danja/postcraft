When you're feeling better & next looking at your auto-gen script bits on chatgpt, can you give me a clue how it might conceivably work for this : in the background I have chatgpt working on the lisp.py again, this time on /mnt/data/ (hopefully).
 First target would be to package it up in such a way as to run and behave as a Lisp repl. I've seen there are published GPTs and they've just announced there'll be a Store. Haven't a clue how that might tie in... 
The latest at https://github.com/danja/lispy 
lispy.py basically works (the 'unless' keyword isn't implemented properly and the test file isn't hooked up properly).
This is totally toy but I can imagine your share/generate kind of things could be really cool for the xmpp agents. Also, side hustles..?
I'd better do some of this proofreading...
(Grr, and my net is intermittent)
