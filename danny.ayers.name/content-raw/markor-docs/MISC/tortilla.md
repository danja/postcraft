Tortilla de patatas. Wasn't bad, despite lacking some ingredients (see r/ididnthavetheeggs). But I had the craving.

The way I make it, ideal circumstances:

Chopped onion, fried in *loads* of good olive oil until translucent. Chopped garlic chucked in late on.

At the same time, thick-sliced potato boiled until getting a bit soft, call it 6 mins. Drain, leave in colander until fairly dry on the surface.
(The way I've seen it made in Spain, the spuds are fried along with the onion, but I find parboiling easier, less pan stickiness to deal with).

Whisk some eggs with a grind of black pepper. Dump in the spuds, onion & garlic (holding back the oil in the frying pan). Gently stir so the spuds get a bit eggy.
Into the frying pan.
Fry one side until brown (peep under with spatula). Put a plate on top to flip. Brown the other side.
I only put salt on afterwards, again helps avoid pan stickiness.

Today I only had sunflower oil (because €€€) and bizarrely no onions. Made up for the latter by using much more garlic.
Toms & valeriana for salad, dressed with a squirt of lemon juice (no good oil!). Blop of mustard. Bread, appropriately enough, pane integrale patate.
