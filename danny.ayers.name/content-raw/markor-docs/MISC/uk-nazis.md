Pretty good analysis of the role of social media in the micro-uprisings in the UK.
Other factors: Farage & co. have backing from wealthy (many foreign) puppeteers; bot activity from agencies (notably Russian) aimed geared towards fear, doubt and uncertainty - goal being destabilisation.

For decades politicians (UK & global) have been scapegoating minorities, normalising anti-immigrant, -Muslim, -non-binary... attitudes. Starmer has seen how populism appeals so isn't inclined to counter the status quo.

So once again, the British public has been failed by the parasites on high, will have to take the reins and prevent the rise of fascism. Fortunately the current (national) front is a castle built on sand. 

The far right's biggest strength is that they've figured out how to play Facebook and Twitter. It's time for folks that don't want to live under tyranny to do the same. 
Street battles are too messy (and hurt).

Consider this a call to (virtual) arms. 

Get online, be respectful, informative to misguided people. Counter lies with facts and reason. 

Most of all : highlight the wannabe despots' biggest weakness - they are ridiculous characters, one and all.

Farage is the pub bore, loud and a bit thick. The bloke who tries hard (but fails) to hide his deep racism. Slags off women out of frustration with brewer's droop. The one who you escape by pretending a complete stranger is a great friend you haven't seen in years.

Tommy Robinson is a failed drunken football hooligan. Has spent a lot of time in prison for pathetically dim and arsey crimes. Was giving a court order to prevent him stalking a female journalist. To complete the picture of a total dick, his real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon.
