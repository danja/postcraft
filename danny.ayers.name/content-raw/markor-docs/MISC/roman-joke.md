A cartoon has been found on a Roman carving, with the joke :
A traveller has a break from his journey at a bar. The landlord is adding up the bill :
Wine and bread with pulmantarium sauce, €1
"Ok", says the traveller.
Then there's the girl you were with, €8
"Fine", says the traveller.
Then it'll be €2 for the hay your mule ate.
The traveller says, "that bloody mule will be the ruin of me!".
