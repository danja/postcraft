Could introducing an extra time dimension help solve the problems getting a unified theory of physics?

I've been postponing getting out of bed because it's cold. This is where it took me. Absolutely not my field, but it annoys me like a dripping tap.

The mismatch between quantum and macro mechanics may suggest there's an mistake in fundamental assumptions. Our theories align to our observations, but in turn those are largely geared towards our experiences. The basic 3,1 dimension spacetime is a good fit for most things from our pov. But to fix inconsistencies, string/m-theories throw in more spaces.

Looking at the number of time dimensions, 1 seems sacrosant. But if you squint at the multiverse-style patches to the theories, a universe splitting makes 2x(3,1), which could be mapped (somehow) to (6,2).

How would you find if there might be more than one time dimension? 

One angle would be to check if existing formula could be refactored to include T2. Anomalous predictions might help to see how T2 might be packaged in.

To start, if there is a T2 that doesn't have any interactions with the others is trivially possible : it's there, just doesn't affect the price of fish.

Another angle would be to compile the particle collider, gravitational, cosmological etc observations that don't fit the sums and algorithmically check where T2 might give a better fit.

(It's not my field, but I have read of constants being introduced that look like a fudge. Introducing a new arbitrary variable would explode the equations. But the relations between T1 and other features must have been mostly pinned down, so the equation problem space for where a T2 could go might be tractable).

One final angle : an experiment!
Something analogous to the double-slit looking for *temporal* interference.

Newton's view works so far, but Einstein's further. 


When I first heard about dark matter & energy, it sounded like a situation where sums give such bad results it was time to start again from scratch. Subsequently I've read it's not quite that bad, but. Then the mismatch between quantum mechanics and bigger things.
