I stumbled on a medieval woodcarving of Claudio (well, a replica)  - on a choir screen in Carlisle Cathedral!
Couldn't find a pic of the original. But this made it worth visiting their web site:

"Of just 17 Scandinavian runic inscriptions in mainland England, two - both dating from the 12th century - have been found in the Cathedral. One [...] reads: ‘Dolfin wrote these runes on this stone.’ The second [...] is the single name ‘Reginald’."
