You've already crossed the Rubicon. So spend at most a couple of months revising/extending the book, offer it to a publisher, get it in print. Keep that title! It'll appeal to many idiot managers who think themselves decision makers, tech people struggling to find their feet in this stuff, lay people who want to learn but not be talked down to.

From what I've skimmed, you know your stuff & have a very approachable style, but prone to mix the light & deep. But you can cover the bases. I'd suggest surface narrative pop-science, including management speak, but backed up by plenty of academically solid references.

Get anyone you can to review it. It will be serious agony at times, but will force you towards improvements. 

Check the bestseller lists, say US, India, UK. Proper tech around AI, broader webdev etc, plus the sensationalist nonsense. Leverage that for marketing, but yours will have sound content...
There will have been a flood of AI books at publishers doors, but you can differentiate this with the 'decision makers' angle, together with it actually containing good information.
