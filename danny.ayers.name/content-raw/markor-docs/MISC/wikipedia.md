@Graham87 thank you Graham! I haven't looked here in at least 11 years apparently. I'm guessing that was around the time I got blocked. I truly haven't a clue how exactly I got blocked, but can hypothesize. Two most likely scenarios : I got into a stupid argument about tech with someone, we each pushed way further than justified, they complained first. I was involved in things that got absurdly contentious at the time (syndication formats). Or, I simply said very bad things on the page of a politician or similar person I disliked while drunk. Either way, I apologise unreservedly to the good people of Wikipedia. Nowadays I am much better at avoiding the silly arguments, and long since moved from wine to beer, I haven't screamed obscenities at the Internet for years. And I know, if I ever get the urge, there's always Reddit.
