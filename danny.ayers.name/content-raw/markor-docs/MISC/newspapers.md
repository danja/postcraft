My phone charger connection is playing up, led me to spend the last hour reading online newspapers at a 30° angle. Not a bad way to counteract editorial slant. 

I usually rely on The Guardian (UK) for news, they're usually reliable with facts, even though they're as bad as the rest in the way they present/ignore things. It's a common feature, blatantly obvious if you flip through a few rags. 

Case in point, content-wise the reporting on Trump's latest trial is the same everywhere. Both The Guardian and Fox News imply you should tut-tut the story. But they each project their own distinctive fantasy at which to direct your disapproval. 

Al Jazeera seem to be very good inside their content, just selective in what they cover (it's probably the best source for *European*  news). 

It's usually Fox News that raises my stomach contents, just now it was the Jerusalem Post sent me bucket-hunting. I don't know how someone with strong Jewish connections but not Israel-based would read it, but I found it disturbingly claustrophobic. 
Obviously events relating to Gaza, locally and international ripples, are the main talking point. It's also understable this paper would take an unambiguous position. Ok, my opinions are ~180° from theirs. But it's not that aspect that provokes my visceral nausea. There's just something about the overall tone, style, room full of mirrors, echo chamber about the whole flooded cave. 
In contrast, the New Times of Kigali, in a country that experienced genocide just 30 years ago, gives a feeling of self-awareness without pathological introversion.

I've fortunate in having relatively well-behaved bowels, I'd like them to stay that way, so I skipped the Daily Mail.
