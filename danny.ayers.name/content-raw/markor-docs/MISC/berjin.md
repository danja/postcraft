Fool Danny, I cursed the waiting list bs. Hang on, haven't I seen this before? Yup. Passcode has been in my inbox for ages.

Anyhoo. Here after seeing you post on ActivityPub + AT Protocol. 

First one first : ok, I've not looked closely at the specs of ActivityPub, but I got annoyed with Reddit, wanted a play with Lemmy. Set it up on my remote server. Common protocol right? Same as Mastodon? Not exactly obvious how to connect. I should read more, but my impression was that the protocol is open ended enough that things can't talk to each other without a lot of intervention. cf. *Universal* Serial Bus connectors.
