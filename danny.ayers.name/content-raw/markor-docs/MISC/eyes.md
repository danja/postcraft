I tried out my new eye prescription with my trial lens kit, and I was tempted just to leave the trial lens frame on all the time. 

Well, no, you can't do that. The lenses will fall out, and  your neighbors will be scared. You know those weird people on Doctor Who? That's what you look like wearing a trial lens frame.

What a difference this prescription makes. As it was, I could only go up to the next lowest OD (oculus dexter, otherwise known as 'right eye') value of -6.00 as the lens kit only increases in increments of -0.50 after -6.00. I can't help thinking how much that extra -0.25 will help, even with the cataract obscuring the macula. 

It's interesting, but you can use a pinhole eyeglass lens to determine if you have something obstructing your vision. If you look through a pinhole lens, and there's no obstruction, you should have perfect (if limited) vision. The light is focused to the center in such a way that refraction errors are eliminated. 

You can try this yourself at home by getting a 14 hole eye occluder at Amazon.  Or look through a small hole cut into cardboard. Or just squint. That's why your vision is better when you squint. 

I've always been fascinated by vision since reading David Marr's "Vision". Our eyes are amazing things. I can't wait to get my new glasses.
