I do not envy you your current situation. There's lots of Shakespeare bits with the man being pulled in different directions. Yours, alas, is more like Egdar Allen Poe, 'Cask of Amontillado' where the bloke gets bricked up. (Film gave me nightmares for ages, Vincent Price I think)

I just got lucky, so many times. Coincidentally, women involved on the big ones. Caroline dragged me from Sheffield. More recently I was getting fucked again, Marinella pulled me in.
I think I understand enough about you & Maureen to know it's like they ^^^ were for me. Just they had got themselves sorted before taking me in. 
Not sure if you knew this, Caroline was injecting brown for a fair while when she lived in London. Not when she was with Nigel, he'd have shouted and flushed.
Her boyfriend for a bit, Andy, was a dick.
Got herself sorted, then went and got me. 

Point - very close relationship, both a bit fucked. I got her on the good side. She went. I lost it for quite a while. Heading towards drinking myself to death.
Then Marinella. I did not deserve this. I think she's 71. We did go to bed at the start, then, not she wants, a few weeks later, nah, ok, I'm not really bothered.

Rambling.

MY MAIN POINT

I think you need to pull back, too much time on Maureen and your mother etc. 
I'm hardly going to lecture you on drug taking. But like, look at yourself, what you need. Probably isn't shitloads of white or whatever. Fair enough keeping up the methadone & brown if you need it. White, the little pipes I've had, can see how you'd want it. Pace yourself. 
I fucked up a lot with wine, too much for me to cope with, just get obliterated. 

Look at yourself, what you need. 
Give yourself a bit of time to steady.
You are in a shitty situation, trying to do the best you can for people you love.
But you're no use to anybody when fucked. Please look at what you need yourself. 
Dunno what. Not telling Maureen and your mother to fuck off. 
But you will be much better for them if you think about yourself a bit more. 
Not try to stop you drug intake,not that at all. Just look at what you yourself can do to make yourself in a better place, whatever.
You've been forgetting the most important person in all these relationships, yourself.
