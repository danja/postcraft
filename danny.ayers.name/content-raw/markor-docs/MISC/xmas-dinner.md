A very pleasant afternoon!
Clockwise, Carlo, Ivonne, Mari, Nino.
Really nice, lovely folks, very comfortable, great food.

For antipasti Mari made some new-to-me melanzana 'pizzas'. Just slices of aubergine , I didn't see but guessing fried in pan on one side, then smear of tom puree + cheese on top, grilled.
Tasty little treats!
She'd also made a very nice torta, flaky pastry crust quiche, egg+cheese+zucchini.

The primi, I think Ivonne brought. Meaty little tortallini in brodo (delicate flavour, I didn't catch the origin) for all but Ivonne (veggie). She had spinach tortelli.

Secondo, I just asked if it had a name, call them chicken rolls for now. A thickish slice of lean chicken, a thin slice of some kind of (smoked?) meat, sage leaves, rolled up and held together with a toothpick. Result the size of a medium potato.
Somehow cooked in mini-oven with a smidgen of Parmigiano sauce...somehow. Could only just taste the cheese, but it really enhanced the flavour. Very tasty indeed, and chicken + sage made it seasonal!

The main dolce was an apple & cinnamon torta that Ivonne had made (with their own apples).
I've had pieces of those quite a few times this year, this was by far the best. All the others had been way too sweet and/or stodgy. This one was spot on, delicious.
Lots of different kinds of bought cakes & chocs.
Coffee.
