I just video called. Rather strange. She's very preoccupied with what's going on around her (it was very noisy with voices). Said some incoherent things about there, but then was lucid about a lot of things. Early on she said Joan and Harry had visited - he's been dead for years. But a bit later on she said the same thing again, and corrected herself, not Harry... 
It was like she was pretty much ok for a couple of minutes, then brain scrambled for a couple of minutes, repeat. Really bitchy about the staff one minute (echoes of granny there), then full of praise. She asked me very coherently about my tenant here, things like, "did you get the house insurance sorted?". Wasn't remembering names much, but asked after Claudiopup, all very normal. Then would say something I couldn't really make sense of.
Physically she looked a total wreck. But she was very animated, chatty (kept going back to the stuff going on around her), not particularly distressed, just a bit of grumpy annoyance.
