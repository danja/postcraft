Video call from my mother, all well. She'll always complain about her health in some way, like last week it was all haemorrhoids, today something about her cheeks (facial). It's not hypochondria, more like Munchausen's syndrome, but that doesn't quite fit either, grumbling about the state of your arse isn't the greatest approach for getting attention. She has a fairly debilitating heart condition, sometimes she's properly ill, but what she's says isn't a reliable reference. 

Call from my mother just now, all well. Shown by a particularly good grumble about cousin Joan. Apparently Jonny, Joan's son, mowed half of their lawn. Had to stop when the handle of the mower fell off. My mother had spoken to Joan afterwards, suggested the mower might be old. Joan said definitely not. Other (more mechanically-minded) cousin Nick had a look later on. Declared the mower *ancient*. My mother just told me this, followed by "Joan is so fucking tight" [sic!] Which, irrespective of how penny-pinching Joan is (very), indicates my mother is feeling very well today.
