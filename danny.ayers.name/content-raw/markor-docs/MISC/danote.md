Wow, Suno queued for a music room session tonight. But I do see a potential issue for me with it. I'm a crude guitar/bass player, lousy on keyboards and still a beginner on clarinet. But relatively speaking, I'm a virtuoso on all of those compared to how bad my singing is...

I *may* have another sorting out xmpp server later. It's crucial to the stuff I want to get onto asap. I got pretty close to getting things working last week, but my head wandered off. I had a really useless weekend, sent my mood right down. Then started the week with stubborn task paralysis - the Todo list overwhelmedness flavour. So I deployed structured procrastination. Good move, I actually had a really productive week, meandering around random lowish priority tasks...  But it seems to have worked, a few little shots of dopamine, got me back into a more positive frame of mind. I'm going to leave myself lots of slack over the weekend, refocus Monday morn.
