Earlier I cut the patch of grass in front of the house. Claudio demanded a second walk, so it was a little while before I got around to sweeping up the clippings that had gone in the road. 
While there, I noticed that the grate, water drain, just below my corner, had plants growing out of it. I couldn't lift one side without a crowbar, but got the other up. Brambles & random weeds. Also this. 
The leaves have been mangled, poking your head up into the middle of the road is dangerous. But it's unmistakably a fig tree - how unexpected/wonderful is that!?
The tall tree on the left in the photo is Federico's fig, a fruit must have rolled uphill. Dark now, I'll put it in a pot tomorrow.
