One thing I can rely on for amusement these days is my slow wit. It just gave me a beauty. Consider how you'd address the problem I had. A room full of electronic/musical equipment I value, the air is soggy thanks to a rainy Easter weekend & a leaky roof. I do have a little electric dehumidifier in there, it's pulled out a litre of water since whenever I switched it on some time last week. I also have *one* little temperature/humidity gadget. The rain finally stopped this morning, in fact the sun is now shining. Warming the wet ground. 

Do I open the windows? 

I bought the temperature/humidity gadget when winter was particularly biting, Dan Brickley mentioned these things in the context of draught-detection. ('Xiaomi Mi Temperature and Humidity Monitor', about â‚¬10 from Amazon). I believe he said they do Bluetooth. The dampness dilemma reminded me, I put the gadget in there. Ok, I need one inside the window, one outside, hook up my computer somehow to gather the data. Can you get a PC-USB Bluetooth transceiver to flip between devices? I spent a fruitless 30mins looking if I'd taken notes about the things. Note to self, look this up. Then a little while to find on Amazon, added to Wishlist for *soon*. Then, ok, nothing more I can do now, back to other desk activities.

Ok, my wit. I'm of an age where I really don't feel a need to prove anything to anyone. Even the 'mature' phase of needing to prove things to myself is long gone. When it comes to intelligence in the usual sense, I'd rate mine *at best* average. This doesn't come from false modesty, simply years of observation. I'll use the word 'neurodiversity' for shorthand, noting it's a feature of everyone. My particular bit of the multidimensional cognitive rainbow means I'm very, very good at some things, truly awful at others. My superpower is (intermittent) persistence with things that interest me; my Kryptonite, time. It takes a bloody long time for the obvious to occur to me sometimes.   

So after halting at the humidity hurdle for an hour or so, I went back to what I'd intended to do today. Then something occurred to me. By now the gadget will have a good reading of the humidity inside the window - 67%. Now, how about I put it outside the window for a bit? So I did. 55%. 
Windows opened.
