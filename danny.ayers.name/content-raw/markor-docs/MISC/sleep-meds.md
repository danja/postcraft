I'm prescribed trittico. I think the shrink had it in mind for antidepressant/antianxiety bits initially, but I didn't notice any effect at all on affect. But it does work quite well as a sleeper, if I time myself right. There's a small window about an hour after taking it, if I can be in bed & comfortable then, I'm down. If I don't catch that window, is just like normal. Can (un)happily doom scroll until 4+.
The last couple of weeks I've been trying melatonin. Hoping to get to sleep before 1am, so taking 1mg around 10pm (effects about an hour later, apparently), another some time before 12. I skimmed a paper which suggested it could shift your circadians. I have been sleeping & waking earlier recently, but that might just be down to the season.
