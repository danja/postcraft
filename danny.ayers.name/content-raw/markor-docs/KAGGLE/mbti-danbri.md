Brainstorming on the Kaggle ChatArena challenge, it occurred to me that it might be useful to involve profiles, models of things that are quasi- out-of-band. Things like the topic (astronomy or hamsters) and/or style of the prompts/responses (say, plain facts or narrative). Another is the personality of the actors... Hmm, Myers-Briggs... Quick google for datasets - top hit, some on Kaggle!

Has a bunch of Reddit posts from people who have declared their MBTI type on a site called Personality Cafe.
I've not read the challenge rules properly yet or looked at the starter ref code. But the overall implementation approach I'm thinking of, at least for now, is to use agents. So (maybe) you give an agent the prompt & 2 responses, it gives a personality type for each, together with similarity measures or whatever. Another agent with topic etc. Then these are used in ensemble somehow, maybe as a prompt for a regular LLM which gives the final prediction.
I already have various reasons for wanting to look at some of the more old school supervised & unsupervised learning approaches for knowledge management. Done this way, it also ties in with the agent bits I want to play with - yay!
