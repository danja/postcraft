My weaknesses :
I have neither the experience nor the breadth of knowledge needed to approach this head on. 

My strengths :
I am less likely to have tunnel vision and use established approaches. I can hack.

Surface relevance matching between query and responses will only be one factor, maybe not even the most significant.

Personality matching is probably a thing.

Sentiment analysis is likely to be useful. Whether the responses are positive.

Structural : step by step or narrative.

Topic : is it technical or creative
