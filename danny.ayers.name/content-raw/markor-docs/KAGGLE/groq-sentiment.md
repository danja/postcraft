Please act as an experienced ai systems analyst and developer. I am an experienced developer, technical description is fine. Our job is to build a small machine learning system. 
Right now we need to describe what a flexible framework would need at an abstract level. We will discus implementation details later.
The system will be able to accept a variety of text input data and give simultaneously me the following :
supervised learning of topic - content mapping;
Unsupervised learning of the same, so that new topic areas can be discovered. 
There will only be a very small amount of labelled data available, but mases of unlabelled.
The topics should be accessible so they can be used for search, ie, relevance to a query. Also in reverse, so for example a blog post could be passed to the system and it might return the classifications 'education' 'animals' 'dog' 'health'. 
Additionally some more general classifications should be available, such as as 'verbosity' versus 'conciseness', 'structured' versus 'unstructured' in explanation, narrative style etc. Other key features to be measured are the voice - active or passive, and the sentiment, positive or negative.
Please first give a list of the algorithms and approaches that may be most appropriate. Remember these. Consider combinations of algorithms. Then describe the kind of infrastructure subcomponents that will be needed to evaluate the approaches.
Please keep your responses very concise.

## Algorithms and Approaches:

**Supervised Learning:**

* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling
* Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) for topic modeling
* Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for content-topic mapping


**Unsupervised Learning:**

* Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for topic discovery
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic discovery
* Self-Clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) for identifying clusters of related terms


## Infrastructure Subcomponents for Evaluation:

**1. Data Preprocessing:**
- Text normalization and cleaning
- Feature extraction (word2vec, TF-IDF)


**2. Model Training and Evaluation:**
- Cross-validation for model selection
- Evaluation metrics:
    - perplexity for topic coherence
    - coherence score for topic-document relevance
    - NDCG for search ranking


**3. Explanation and Visualization:**
- Topic word clouds
- Topic coherence measures
- Relevance scores for documents and queries


**4. Infrastructure for Continuous Learning:**
- Online learning algorithms for updating the model with new data
- Change detection algorithms to detect shifts in the underlying topics


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Transfer learning:** Leverage labelled data from other domains to improve performance on the limited labelled data available.
* **Active learning:** Strategically select unlabelled data points for labelling to improve model performance.
* **Explainability and interpretability:** Make the model's workings understandable to users.
