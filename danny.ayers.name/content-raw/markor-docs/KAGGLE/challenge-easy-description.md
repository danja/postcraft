The competition challenge is based on a site called Chatbot Arena. There you can chat with two different AIs simultaneously. You ask a question, both give responses. You then vote for which you thought was better. You can chat for multiple turns until you decide on a winner.
Lots of these interactions have been recorded : question, two responses, vote.
The challenge is to take this data and given a question and two responses, predict how a person would vote.

Participation

You have 3 months to write code to solve the problem. There's a set of data you can download to experiment on, and you can submit sets of results along the way to test against other blocks of data.
There's a leaderboard so you can get a rough idea how well other people are doing, but the final submissions are at the end of 3 months against a different block of the data.
It's been running for 5 days, so far it says:
1,288 Entrants
149 Participants
144 Teams
552 Submissions

Many of those will be serious experts, so I don't stand much chance of winning a (cash!) prize. But the faint hope should help with motivation

Ask any question to two anonymous models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Llama) and vote for the better one!
You can chat for multiple turns until you identify a winner.
