I'm a coder by trade and for fun. My main long-term hobby project is building a system to help me be more efficient at getting things done. I started this long before my diagnosis, but it's obvious now that I was trying to minimise the problems my particular brain wiring causes and maximise the benefits of the useful bits.
It's occurred to me that a critical aspect of pretty much everything I do is learning new stuff.
