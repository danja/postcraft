It reinforces my suspicions that not only do we understand very little about such things, but that current psych approaches to understanding them are way off the mark. 

I can attest first hand that there can be benefit in pathologising these conditions. A diagnosis can lead to medical intervention (ie. drugs) that can fairly predictably improve quality of life. 

But I think the illness-cure mindset fails in at least two ways. Most people's bodies are similar enough to each other that the notion of a 'normal' does make sense. Sure, there are things like genetic factors, such as those behind lactose intolerance and sickle cell anaemia, that means 'normal' has something of a spread. But a take a condition like diabetes. It's observably associated with an imbalance in insulin levels. There is a commonality between people of what is normal and what is the cause of sickness.
