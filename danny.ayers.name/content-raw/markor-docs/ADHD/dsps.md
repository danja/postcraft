I don't know if this has come up here before, but it was new to me  (late diagnosis, a lot is new!).

From Wikipedia:
 
"[Delayed sleep phase disorder] is genetically linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by findings of polymorphism in genes in common between those apparently involved in ADHD and those involved in the circadian rhythm and a high proportion of DSPD among those with ADHD.".

There are a load of papers linked from the ADHD paragraph on that page (which I've not yet looked at).

Myself, I've always had lousy sleep patterns, often insomnia. When I was younger I just put it down to being a night owl and lifestyle (way too many late nights with booze). But noticing my behaviour more recently it seems more like, while I can do the wake/sleep needed for a day job for a while, it doesn't take much to knock it out sync. One late night and I'm messed up for weeks.

My psychiatrist has prescribed me Trazodone for this side of things. It's listed as an antidepressant etc, but I've not noticed any difference there. But if I take a 75mg pill when I'm thinking about bed, about an hour later there's a short window when, if I'm snuggled in bed, I'm much more likely to fall asleep. Miss the window and it's like I never had the pill.

I've recently started trying taking melatonin, late evening. I think there might be some beneficial effect, but it's to soon to judge it properly.
