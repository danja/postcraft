[Oops, sorry, this was intended as a quick note, but I had a weekend without Ritalin, just got supply, dosed, let some major verbals commence...]

I only recently got a diagnosis, I'm very clumsy. Superficially maybe coincidence, neither of those are that uncommon. But digging a little...I strongly suspect there may be a link.

I put my clumsiness down to being left-handed, but even there I was wrong until fairly recently. 
Reading up, it seems I'm 'cross-dominant'. For me personally, anything that needs strength (hammer), right hand. Anything for accuracy (pen) left. It's entertainingly visible on my hands: right one is covered in scars, looks like that of a quarry worker. Left is that of an 18th century French aristocrat.

Hypothesis : Assuming (based on a few anecdotes) there is a connection, my guess would be that for people with brain wiring around ADHD,  the 'muscle memory' pathways don't develop as efficiently as they might otherwise. With the result that many of the basic sensory-motor behaviours that usually become automatic stay dependent on immediate cognitive attention.

My own single data point in support of this : Ok, in general, I am poorly coordinated physically, can't think offhand of anyone I know that is clumsier. But when I am fully concentrating on something, my physical control is exceptionally good. 

In my crazy-big (now I know ADHD-generated) bag of hobbies, I have electronics. Normally when I'm soldering prototypes I use strip board PCBs with 0.1" hole spacing. With wires dangling everywhere this calls for careful dexterity. Easy. I've occasionally soldered SMD chips with dozens of pins on a 0.5mm spacing. They were difficult, but not because of my handling, my eyesight (and/or positioning a magnifier) was the limiting factor.

Scaling up, another hobby, wood carving. I may start on a (say) 6" cube of wood, roughing out with larger gouges &  mallet, heavy blows. At that scale I'd guess I am relying on some muscle memory, but am at least as guided by an internalized idea of how the wood is going to behave. Finer detail with smaller gouges, hand only, that's very like the soldering.

Scaling up to whole-body, I recently took up indoor climbing. You have to concentrate to avoid falling off (onto very soft pads, but the instinct not to fall is strong). So there are the holds your hands & feet are currently using, any strain you're feeling. Looking how to make the next move. Your position/balance *now* is very important, and is during your movement and target. Obviously physical factors like brute strength are important, but they're just another aspect of the mental challenge. 

Anyhow, I'm physically weak and so far hopeless at technique. (Wonderful contrast, there's a girl goes, maybe 13, her attractiveness must be torture for her classmates. She's slim but not with a noticeably athletic physique, delicate even. Powers up making it look easy, does monkey-style dynos from hold to hold. Absolute Spiderwoman!).
I may only manage 2 or 3 moves before going 'plop!', but in the moment it's the exact opposite of clumsiness. I become really aware of what is going on with my body and how it relates to the space around.

So I'm demonstrably capable of reasonably high-grade physical coordination. 
Yet I'll regularly go to perch on the end of the couch to put my shoes on, misjudge, go arse over tit on the floor.

( Btw, I'd strongly recommend climbing to anyone with ADHD tendencies. It makes you think in ways you wouldn't expect, and paradoxically seems anti-anxiety. It's very easy to get started - I'm 59 and unfit. I've found it great fun, it has to be good exercise and after an hour's session I've felt more relaxed, calmer in my head, than I have for years. And back then it took narcotics.  )

Interesting that quick responses have been noted, I'm a bit like that. Can't say whether it's innate or developed from practice at being clumsy...

Coincidentally I've had the exact same experience with more than one guitar. In a way the first big scratch has been a Good Thing. It stopped me treating it with kid gloves, easier to think about playing.
I'm now trying to learn clarinet, picked up a lovely 2nd hand instrument off eBay. If that gets a knock it could easily do a lot more than aesthetic damage. 
Clumsiness workaround, before even trying to get a note out of it I made a sturdy stand. If I stumble against it I'll know (and get bruised) long before it hits the deck.

As for coping with clumsiness, I guess the main strategy I've developed (over many years pre-diagnosis) is just to accept it as yet another little devil of life that seems to pick on me more than most other people. (In retrospect, it no doubt was another enemy of self-confidence in early school etc. Hey ho.)

But practical tips, yeah, I have a couple.

Outside of the home, I know I'm much prone to misadventure in new and/or confusing situations. It's now second nature for me to (at least try) to act ultra-slowly even in what should be a benign environment.  

Eg. Visiting local bar: exaggerated pause at the door, down the couple of steps, long pause to take everything in before moving *slowly* to the counter. 

My minor social anxiety isn't a problem in itself, but is enough for me to take my eyes off the ball. I am the person who when introduced to someone new will either stand up to shake hands and send my chair into the face of someone behind, or reach across the table and send all the glasses flying.
When I remember, take a beat, repeat the introducer's words in my head, look around for spatial awareness before the impulsive move gets a look-in.

Inside the home (overlapping a bit with outside), the strategies that work for me are very close to those that help avoid losing stuff etc. 

Overall, the principle of 'a place for everything, and everything in it's place' seems extremely valuable.
 **This I'd give as my No. 1 tip for anyone with ADHD issues.**
Here's why :

More through luck than judgement, I now own a reasonably large house, just me & Claudio dog. The luxury of being able to partition activities & objects by room. But I know now that had I followed this principle as much as possible when I lived in a tiny bedsit, I'd have been much more productive and had a better quality of life.

First, knowing you will understand, at any given point in time most of it will be a mess. *But*, it's never one great homogenous mess. Today, the office is seriously untidy, cluttered. The music room, aside from a few cables and bits of notes strewn around, reasonably well organised. The kitchen/living room is a pigsty, borderline health hazard. 
But because each room is in my head as a space with a different purpose, I don't get totally paralysed by 'everything is a mess', even when in reality it often is.

That side is handy, but where this principle really shines is in productivity. 

A trad version would be to take your notebook and textbooks down to the library to study.

But I recently saw the same concept described in the context of computer programming, for folks working from home. 
I'd guess a large proportion of people doing this kind of work will for practical reasons, have one good laptop for everything: work; gaming; social media annex to phone; r/CatsAreAssholes; study; prawn etc. 

The advice there is : don't dive straight into a coding session. First close everything that isn't directly relevant. Save whatever necessary (eg. All current browser tab into a folder), wipe the deck clean.

Don't forget, same goes for the phone, close everything but the absolute essentials (I have notifications off for everything except WhatsApp, so I can only get interruptions from one of a couple of close friends, or my mother video-calling).

Now open everything you are going to need (eg. for me, that's VSCode for the actual coding, a terminal window, a homemade text editor thing for notes, a handful of bookmarked web pages for ref, and because we live in the future,  ChatGPT in a window of it's own).

In doing this you have created a space that's entirely geared towards that particular activity.
Mine is slightly enhanced : say there's some particular thing I need to work on. Taking a fresh coffee and tobacco, I go to The Office, gathering any books/papers I might need. Sit at desk in a comfy but upright chair. Put on some music that's got a little momentum (usually classical or thud-thud-thud) but that is familiar/genre-tied enough that it won't get too interesting. Prepare machine as above. 

Here, another ADHD trick. I have a little mechanical kitchen timer. Set it. Work-work stuff I usually I go for 60 mins, meaning that *or more*. Any admin, 30 mins or more. Anything unrelated or tangential to the planned, 30 mins *or less*.

I have two monitors, one large enough to work on comfortably, the other is a bit small but ok for ref & writing notes.
First I check my notes from last session, see where I was at on main screen. Add anything that might have come to mind. 

At this point all my immediate environment is inclined to the task I want to get done. Everything's favourable for me getting on with it.

Ok, you all know what it's like. Easiest enough to stall a long time in bed or on couch before even getting to the coffee pot. Shy off the next steps, for me walking up a few stairs to office.
But:

```
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. You might also consider the chances of it drinking if you don't lead it to water.
```

Making as much as possible so routine that you don't need to think about it, let alone it feeling an obstacle. 
Slide downhill into a place where the work is actually the easiest activity at that point.

But for life in general, clear place/objects/activities associations I reckon are really helpful.

I have a small but cosy kitchen/living room for relaxation. Couch. An old laptop always sits in the same place for tv. Cooking/food things (should be) organized like any typical kitchen.

A huge room I use as an office. Computer & current project-related materials on a desk, things getting less immediate by distance.

I have a little quasi-separate workshop, mostly tooled up for woodwork, but with a big diy bench, takes any diy.

A music room - centred around a desktop PC set up primarily for music stuff (Reaper on Ubuntu, works a treat). Guitars, synths etc. But *everything* in that room is solely for music purposes. (Sorry, there is a big bookshelf against one wall, but that's separated from the rest by a barrier I put up to stop Claudio as a pup peeing on music gear and chewing on cables: audio, midi *and* mains).

I've also got bedroom, bathroom, The Lab (so-named because I intended to use it for hobby-science, has become a dumping ground for Stuff), cantina (basement, the legitimate dumping ground for Stuff).

The bedroom is for sleeping. Bathroom, those things. Music room, music. 

This principle can work on different scales.

Rain sounds like it's easing off, still haven't said the bits most relevant to OP's question.

Guitar. Last Xmas a dear friend gave me a steel-strung acoustic, just what I always wanted. This I didn't want in music room, liked the idea of having it in the living room, pure leisure. If I got the urge for a strum, no need to go upstairs.
But it needs a place.

Plan A, I already had a suitable floor stand. Within a couple of days I bumped into it, lucky not to break it's head on the tiles. Claudio doesn't per everywhere like he did as a pup, but this was still a danger zone.

Plan B, it came with a soft padded case. Stick it in that, lean it up in the corner.
That didn't last long. Hassle to take it in & out, would knock the tuners.

Plan C worked. The fireplace projects into the room, centre of one wall. Space one side just the right width. I put a hook in the beam above, close to the wall. The thin foam packing it came with hung neatly from that against the wall. Paracord around the head, up on the hook, back leans gently against the foam against the wall.

Safe place, easy to get down, importantly just as easy to put back.

....


Please let me repeat this bit. Right now I live in a place (in every sense) that's better for me than I could ever have imagined. I landed this house through an unexpected series of events I had virtually zero control over. There was a horrible tragedy along the way, but at this point in time I'm inexplicably fortunate. I have worked very hard on various things over the years, but always at bringing in the $$$s. A little irony there is the other result of a dice roll, how my brain is wired, makes me (aside from the rare niche) virtually unemployable.

Wow, this has become another feature length. 

I need to take Claudio out for a walk, but there's a huge thunderstorm right now. I won't be able to concentrate on anything else until walk's done. 

Internal verbals, meds-driven. I hope you don't mind, I'll let a bit more out of the tank here.

I've only been on Ritalin a few months. *Very* positive effects. I had sought out psych professionals several times in the past. Diagnosed with anxiety & depression, chronic alcoholism along for the ride. Each time I was prescribed some mix of random SSRIs, sedatives etc. Each time they made me feel a bit different in different ways, but not better in any way.
 After being pulled over for DUI, about 10x the limit one morning after a lot of wine, I was talked into spending a few months in rehab.

That was good in an unexpected way. So I've been trying to learn Italian. I've lived in Italy 20 years, but I don't have the kind of interactions with Italians that'd help with the language. I live in a very rural area, of the 3 good friends I see most locally, one is English and the other two prefer to speak in English because they want to learn it (both pretty fluent) and said 'dibs!'  first. Practically everyone I know online knows English well.
Rehab involved being (voluntarily) confined to a big old villa with a couple of dozen folks with only addiction in common : drink+ problems where I was, the heroin+ folks got planted in another villa nearby. 
But it was a brilliant cross-section of society, without exception friendly people Even the couple of heavy introverts would give you the time of day. Adults, from teen to post-retirement, all walks of life. 

Day-to-day, rehab was as boring as fuck. Multi-layered concrete cake, with a sloppy grey icing and a sprinkle of gravel. That imagery comes to mind because we were set on mundane tasks, I spent days raking leaves off the drive, they called it 'therapy'. (There was no other explicit therapy).

Only one guy, a GP who had to retire early (had previously been downgraded from practicing 
surgery) had fluent English.

Way away from what OP was talking about, but forgive me, I'm still thinking this through (aloud).

My impression is that the profession is generally pretty clueless about ADHD, but at least they've identified some chemicals that seem genuinely useful.

I'm still adjusting to Ritalin. Rabbiting on here is not the ideal use of my cognitive facilities. I'm sure I'll soon be able to channel things more usefully.
But it is infinitely better than spending days on end on the couch, totally devoid of motivation. Or, when I had no choice but to do something, having judgement severely impaired by anxiety. Or getting very drunk to make all these things go away for a bit.

Now, because I've read up a little, seen the effects of this kind of meds on myself (and incidentally had a professional diagnosis), I'll confidentially say my underlying issue is under the ADHD umbrella. The screeching dissonance this was creating against conventional day-to-day living caused big anxiety.

The clinical depression-like symptoms I am, or rather hopefully was, prone to, I find much harder to describe (even to a shrink), let alone explain how they arrive. 
These aren't quite the same as the more usual human feelings of misery, classic melancholy, at worst crippling despair. I've known people who've had that stuff badly, is awful awful. I've had such feelings occasionally, in a relatively light form, usually when recovering from a particularly heavy drinking session and/or particularly heavy girlfriend stuff. Either way, sitting them out has always worked, they lift of their own accord time. Going even more morbid, over the years I've had plenty of suicidal ideation. But for one thing, nothing could ever come of it because I automatically snap out of such trains of thought. For another, it's more abstract in my head, there isn't the mass of despair behind it.

I'll try an analogy, see if I can contrast regular depression with what I was getting. 
Regular : 
There's a mountain, it's snowing heavily. No wind, snow builds up evenly on the slope. Gets to a critical point where a little bit slips, sets of the next bits, pretty soon a full-on avalanche, problems for the village below. 
The snowflakes are thoughts. Only a little weight each, but they pile up on the slope, standard depression. The build up of weight gets to a point where a catastrophe happens. Brain fracture.

Other kind:
Same mountain, did I mention it has lots of irregular peaks? Strong winds. Same snow. It's settling, but not evenly. Little settles on the slopes, more ends up in turbulances around the peaks, sticking against any bits that stick out. It builds up, gravity compresses, you get wonky cornices, solidifying as the weight of the snow compresses it. It's not going anywhere. Huge rigid random ice formations, there for eternity.

Nope, that didn't really work.

 I'm trying to say how internally you can have massive amounts of activity, a lot of it could potential be really useful. But because of the sheer volume of signals crossing each other, there's no real coherence. Net effect is the whole system gets jammed up, resists being directed, locks up, task paralysis. Couch. At best mindless tv + doomscrolling.

Hah, just remembered. This captures a key part -

Long Covid came up in conversation with a friend yesterday. In reference to how something she is working on was taking her a long time. "I think I have Brain Fog naturally". Just to acknowledge, I said "I know what you mean."
She laughed out loud "You've got a bloody Brain Thunderstorm!" 

That.

Muddy dogwalk at 23:22. Torch & wellies.
