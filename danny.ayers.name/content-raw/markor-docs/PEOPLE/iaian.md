Iaian's number is :

+44 7914 813650

He messaged me on WhatsApp, first time ever, the day after you asked me for his number. Have you got some kind of special arrangement with the universe?
 I told him you asked about parking - he said they be over "in a few weeks". No problem with you parking there when they don't need it (use my front when they are here). His long term plan for the building, ideally : quite a lot of restructuring, move the wall back to make more space in front of their, move the forno around that side. But none of that will be happening any time soon. All piano piano.
 
I'm not 100% sure about his Italian language, but I bet it is much better than mine. Message him, all good, he'll fall back on Google if necessary.
