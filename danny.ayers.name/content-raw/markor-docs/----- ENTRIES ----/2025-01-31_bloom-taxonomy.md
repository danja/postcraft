revised edition of Bloom's taxonomy

The revised edition of Bloom's Taxonomy, published in 2001, represents a significant update to the original framework developed by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues in 1956[1][2]. This revision was led by Lorin Anderson, a former student of Bloom, and David Krathwohl, one of Bloom's original collaborators[4][10].

## Key Changes in the Revised Taxonomy

1. **Terminology Shift**: The most noticeable change is the shift from nouns to verbs for category names[1][6]. This change emphasizes the active nature of the learning process.

2. **Restructured Hierarchy**: The order of the highest two levels was swapped, with "Create" becoming the highest level of cognitive complexity[6][11].

3. **Expanded Knowledge Dimension**: The revised taxonomy introduced a separate dimension for types of knowledge, expanding on the original framework[8].

## The New Cognitive Process Dimension

The revised taxonomy presents six levels of cognitive processes, arranged from lower to higher order thinking skills:

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

Each level is associated with specific cognitive processes. For example, "Remember" involves recognizing and recalling, while "Create" involves generating, planning, and producing[4][6].

## Implications for Education

The revised Bloom's Taxonomy offers several benefits for educators:

1. **Dynamic Learning**: It emphasizes a more dynamic conception of classification in learning[3].

2. **Clearer Instructional Goals**: The use of action verbs provides clearer guidance for setting learning objectives[6].

3. **Improved Assessment**: It allows for more accurate alignment between educational objectives, activities, and assessments[2].

4. **Metacognitive Awareness**: The revised taxonomy includes metacognitive knowledge, recognizing the importance of students' awareness of their own cognitive processes[2].

The revised Bloom's Taxonomy continues to be a widely adopted tool in education, influencing instructional design, assessment strategies, and learning outcomes across various disciplines[11]. Its focus on active, student-centered learning aligns well with contemporary educational practices and the needs of 21st-century learners.
