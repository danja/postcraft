Claude AI has been my main dev assistant for a while now, I've found his 'Project knowledge' ability very useful (I prepare material with repomix). I reckon I'm justified in anthropomorphizing because he really does act like a person. A very strange person.

Just now, before getting out of bed, I had a little session figuring out how I'll build a web scraper in 2025 (it's been many years since I last made one, much has changed).
Anyhow, we arrived a point where I felt we had all the design prep material we needed. A very useful guide for me was a structural diagram. Claude is very good at generating Mermaid (a simple syntax/renderer) diagrams.
