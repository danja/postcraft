# Cognitive composer 

Semem/hyperdata gui,

Pwa as 

Use perplexity API while I can!

OpenAI has JavaScript thing in chat

IdeagraphNG! https://hyperdata.it/stuff/ideagraph/

Ultimate goal is to simplify (any) problems to a form where they become easy

The zoom, pan, tilt stiff - changing perspective

  problem-solving by simplifying things. Main approaches : decomposing them into smaller pieces or composing (abstracting) smaller pieces  into combined things that are simpler because there's less detail.
  
  Dogfood - this is how I glue all my projects together. Many birds.
  
  How does the agent and artifact model align with sowa's upper ontology?

Value of naming things for composition

---

GUI for semem

A self-generating mind map 

Graph 

Follow-up : My Q1, Q2, Perplexity

Buttons for decompose, ~~abstract~~ compose

Compose - select a group of nodes, combine

### Connecting - 

Pick two nodes, how do you link them (if active, what lingua?)

RDF graph walking to create sentences for llms

Graph walking (rag) 

Euler, eye

Nodes like w6, 

upper ontology - 

Borrow from agent/artifact model

A Thing has agentic features and artifactic features (affordances)

Icon generator? Emoticon lookup - check workflows & perplexity

Icons from protege etc

#:Todo

Extend rdf-elements - 

Abstract out the coords etc, allow for 4d

[Elkjs](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs)

### initial main views : 

Two lists : mode (?), layout

* Mind map with Force directed
* Workflow - like node red
* Folder tree

Nodes are zoomable

4+ pane UI with tabs
- make simple version of pulsar

Split horizontally/vertically

Each pane is a view of a resource

A resource may have affordances - a view is Actions - pipe resources to tools (eg. 

Hypermedia

Zigzag
