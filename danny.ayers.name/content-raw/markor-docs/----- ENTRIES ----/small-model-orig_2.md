lowest viable resource continuous learning transformer model architecture for seq2seq learning

To create the lowest viable resource continuous learning transformer model architecture for seq2seq learning, we can combine several efficient approaches:

## Lightweight Base Architecture

The foundation of our model would be a parameter-efficient transformer like EdgeFormer[1][8]. EdgeFormer uses:

- A deep encoder and shallow decoder structure
- Innovative feed-forward network design
- Shared parameters across layers

This allows it to achieve strong performance with fewer than 10 million parameters, making it suitable for on-device seq2seq tasks.

## Continual Learning Mechanisms

To enable continuous learning, we can incorporate:

1. Transformer Calibration[7]: This method uses attention calibration modules (ACM) and feature calibration modules (FCM) to dynamically adjust the model for new tasks without catastrophic forgetting.

2. Dynamic Token Expansion[3]: As new tasks are learned, we can add task-specific tokens to the model, allowing it to expand its capabilities with minimal parameter growth.

## Efficiency Optimizations

To further reduce computational and memory requirements:

- Use adaptive input representations and adaptive softmax[19] to reduce embedding parameters.
- Implement quantization and pruning techniques to compress the model.
- Utilize knowledge distillation[13] to transfer knowledge from larger models to our lightweight architecture.

## Continuous Time Modeling

For handling irregularly sampled time series data efficiently:

- Incorporate multi-view signature attention[5][9], which uses path signatures to capture both local and global dependencies in continuous-time representations.

This combined approach would result in a highly efficient seq2seq transformer architecture capable of continuous learning across diverse tasks while maintaining a small parameter count and low computational requirements. The exact architecture would need to be fine-tuned based on specific task requirements and resource constraints.
