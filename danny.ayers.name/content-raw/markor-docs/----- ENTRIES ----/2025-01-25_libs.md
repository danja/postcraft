Code should be written in modern vanilla JavaScript in a modular style (ES modules when using node) to enable reuse. Dependencies should be kept to a minimum. No frameworks, purpose-specific libraries instead. As cross-platform as possible.
The standard toolkit includes : npm; Jsdoc; jasmine and chai for tests; loglevel for logging; webpack if necessary for browser. Express for web servers - nginx proxies with https are in place. When authentication is needed, use Http basic.
