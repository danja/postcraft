Weatherspoons, Heathrow. 
Not my first choice for 5 in the morning either. But this was the best route for me to get home asap without it breaking the bank. 10 hour stopover at London Heathrow.
I had an early-ish start to his morning from Blackwell. Bus into Buxton, train to Manchester Piccadilly, pause for a pint and pick up something to eat later (there's an ok pub & sarni shop at the Fairfield St. exit).

Ridiculous flight to Heathrow. It didn't register before. 35 minutes. Also, I think the first time I've had WiFi on a plane. By the time I'd gone through the register-for-nothing forms, we were landing.
If that wasn't daft enough, there were only 10 passengers. 
Three cabin staff doing the safety demonstration stuff. One of the best I've seen, real shame it didn't get the audience it deserved.
I legged it out for a cigarette when we landed. Security is always a hassle, the geeky stuff in my bag always raises yellow alerts. But aside from the nicotine, it always seems claustrophobic inside the perimeter.
I didn't really know this airport. Ready for a beer when I arrived. Asked a couple of working guys. Is there a bar, pub nearby? "Yes mate". I forget it exactly, continued with "get the 46 bus over there, go down 8 stops".
Told him I daren't risk going far from the airport, but I could murder a beer without going inside the security zone. "Easy then!". Yup. There's a Marks & Spencer as you go into arrivals. 
Pass time. Funny, I'll write down later.
