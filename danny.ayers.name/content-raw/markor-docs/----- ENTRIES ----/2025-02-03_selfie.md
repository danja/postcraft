I'm looking to balance dev resources over a software project that consists of many subprojects, with many hierarchical dependencies. I'm wondering how to gather metrics. In nodejs, how would you monitor the rate of change of files on the FS? Assuming such data is produced, what kind of visualization might be useful? I'm thinking a spacial representation with a heatmap. How should I proceed?

I understand you're looking to monitor file system changes across projects to visualize development activity patterns.

Task summaries:
1. File monitoring: Use Node.js fs.watch/chokidar for real-time file change detection
2. Data collection: Store timestamps, file paths, and change types in time-series format
3. Data processing: Aggregate changes by directory/project over time intervals
4. Visualization: Create hierarchical heatmap using D3.js treemap with color intensity

Solution:
Implement a file system monitor using chokidar to track file modifications across project directories. Store events in a time-series database (like InfluxDB). Process data to generate heat values based on change frequency. Visualize using D3.js treemap with nested rectangles representing directory structure, color intensity showing activity levels.

I'm looking to monitor file system changes across projects to visualize development activity patterns. The tool will be built on an existing nodejs system that uses a pipeline architecture with a series of of processing steps built of small modules, each of which has a core method, asynch newMessage = processor.process(message), where message is a json object.
Please break down the following into quasi-atomic processes and describe their behaviours and the shape of input/output message shapes for :
1. Module built on Chokidar initiates realtime events corresponding to FS changes, carrying timestamp, filepath etc
2. Events are logged to node-sqlite3 db
3. Db Is queried over latest 24hr interval, aggregated into a  hierarchical [source location] : [churn] tree
4. Visualization of codebase change is created using D3.js treemap with nested rectangles representing directory structure, color intensity showing activity levels.
5. Web page using vanilla as shows the view

Once we have a signature for each processor, we can move onto implementing each, one at a time, with unit and integration tests.
