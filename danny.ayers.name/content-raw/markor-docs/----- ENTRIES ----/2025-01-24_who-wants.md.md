# Who wants to be a millionaire?

Not sure if I've mentioned this before, but I've set myself the goal of becoming a millionaire this year. Wait, bear me out...

Since I got an ADHD diagnosis a couple of years ago I've been much better at working around a lot of my failings. A lot of thwse are systematic, strongly associated with ADHD traits. A big blindspot for me is around working for money. Well, actually it's a lot broader, I don't have a lot of the automatic cause-effect associations most people have without thinking.
