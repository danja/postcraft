## Resources

Everything is a resource

Resource types - ontology
Based on agents & artifacts
A resource can have both agentic and artifactic aspects

<Fred> a :Resource ;
    :hasAspect <librarian> .
<Librarian> a :Aspect ;
   :hasRole <indexing> .
<Indexing> a :Role ;
    :hasCapability <embeddingGen> .
<EmbeddingGen> :uses <Transmission> .



Each item carries its provenance, own even history

Who added it & when, is indexed? - so queues are implicit

## Activities

Activity modes - simultaneous, but computing resource allocation varies

Interaction 

## Agents

Roles like in an org, admin dept, core support tasks : Management Information Services

* Librarians
* Human/agent resources
