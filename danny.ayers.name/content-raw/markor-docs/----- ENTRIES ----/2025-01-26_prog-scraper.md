when might you need a headless browser for scraping pages? which nodejs tools are favoured

You might need a headless browser for web scraping in the following scenarios:

1. Scraping dynamic content: When dealing with websites that rely heavily on JavaScript to render content, a headless browser is essential. These browsers can execute JavaScript and render the full page, allowing you to access content that is not present in the initial HTML response[1][2].

2. Handling complex interactions: If you need to interact with elements on a page, such as clicking buttons, filling forms, or scrolling, a headless browser provides the necessary functionality[3][4].

3. Bypassing anti-bot measures: Headless browsers can help in evading some anti-scraping techniques as they can mimic real user behavior more closely than simple HTTP requests[5][6].

4. Rendering JavaScript-heavy websites: For websites with extensive JavaScript functionality, a headless browser ensures that all dynamic content is properly loaded and accessible[7][8].

5. Automating login processes: When scraping requires authentication, headless browsers can handle complex login procedures more easily[9].

The most favored Node.js tools for headless browser scraping are:

1. Puppeteer: Developed by Google, Puppeteer is a popular choice for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It offers a high-level API and is known for its ease of use[3][4][9].

2. Playwright: Created by Microsoft, Playwright supports multiple browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit) and provides cross-browser automation capabilities[3][5].

3. Selenium: While not exclusive to Node.js, Selenium is a veteran in the industry and supports multiple browsers. It's known for its robust automation capabilities[5][6].

4. Cheerio: Although not a headless browser itself, Cheerio is often used in combination with other tools like Axios for simpler scraping tasks that don't require JavaScript rendering[16].

5. Crawlee: A newer framework built on top of Puppeteer and Playwright, Crawlee is specifically designed for web scraping and crawling[5].

These tools offer various features and trade-offs in terms of performance, ease of use, and compatibility with different browsers. The choice often depends on the specific requirements of your scraping project and the complexity of the websites you're targeting.

Best Node.js tools for web scraping
Extracting data from an HTML and parsing it can seem like a huge challenge for a Node.js engineer tasked with a web scraping project. But once you get your Node.js scrapers up and running, you’ll quickly notice there is a bigger challenge in place — overcoming website blockers, CAPTCHAs, IP bans, and more.

So, how can you build and improve your Node.js scraping infrastructure to avoid getting blocked?

In this guide, we’ll break down the various available Node.js web scraping tools and libraries and explain how you can use them for your data collection projects.

Then, we’ll dive deeper into using advanced scraping APIs, such as ScraperAPI, that are indispensable for higher speed and scale in web scraping.

Never Get Blocked Again
Let ScraperAPI handle all web scraping complexities and start gathering data in minutes

What You Need to Know Before Scraping in Node.js


Scraped data is not equal and you should draw a clear line between what you can and must not scrape. So what are the things you can’t do?



Avoid reselling personal information for commercial purposes. It is against the ethics and standards set by the GDPR and California Consumer Privacy Act
Do not scrape company’s data if there are provisions to APIs, as it is always advised to use them instead of scraping web data
Ensure you are permitted to scrape only relevant endpoints from the user-agent page. To know the right endpoints allowed, check their website robots.txt file, like this: https://amazon.com/robots.txt


The Best Node.js Web Scraping Tools and Libraries


As already mentioned, whatever you want to scrape from the web, these libraries will do the job and meet your data collection needs.



Before writing a line of code, you need to consider the following prerequisites:



Have Node.js installed on your local machine, which comes included with the package manager npm
Have a basic, at minimum, understanding of JavaScript
Knowledge of using the DevTools in the browser to inspect sites’ elements


Done? Now, let’s move to the overview of available tools and libraries you can use for web scraping.



1. Axios and Cheerio


Axios is a promise-based HTTP client developers utilize to send requests from client browsers and Node.js applications, with the page content received as the response.



Thanks to its simplicity, Axios is one of the easiest implementations to fetch HTML code from a web page in JavaScript projects.



On the other hand, Cheerio is a dependency package that parses markup into DOM-like objects, offering an API with methods for traversing and manipulating the code’s data structure. The implementation of Cheerio is reminiscent of jQuery.



To use it, install the package into an initialized project using the following command:



	npm install cheerio axios


Copy-paste this code into the entry point file:



	const express = require('express');
	const axios = require('axios');
	const cheerio = require('cheerio');

	const app = express();

	const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

	const website = 'https://news.sky.com';

	try {
  		axios(website).then((res) => {
			const data = res.data;
    		const $ = cheerio.load(data);

    		let content = [];


    		$('.sdc-site-tile__headline', data).each(function () {
      			const title = $(this).text();
      			const url = $(this).find('a').attr('href');
     	 		content.push({
     	  	 		title,
      	 	 		url,
     			});

      			app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      	  			res.json(content);
      			});
    		});
  		});
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error, error.message)
	}

	app.listen(PORT, () => {
 		console.log(`server is running on PORT:${PORT}`);
	});



In the provided example code:



The Node.js framework Express is employed to exhibit the responses from Axios and Cheerio through the home route endpoint (“/”) using the GET method
The response data from Axios is retrieved and loaded into Cheerio
Cheerio then conducts a search on the website, selecting elements within the document
It iterates through these elements, compiling the content into an array of objects that showcase the page’s title and URL


The anticipated outcome is as follows:

The full code is in this CodeSandbox.

2. Puppeteer


Puppeteer, a headless version of Chrome or Chromium, represents a Node.js library employed programmatically through the CLI (command-line interface) or directly within a Node.js environment.



It emulates the actions of a real user, encompassing activities such as scrolling, clicking, generating screenshots, facilitating automated testing, and more.



To install Puppeteer within your project directory, use the following command:



	npm install puppeteer


For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the freeCodeCamp website to extract its blog title using Puppeteer.



Proceed by copying and pasting the provided code:



	index.js
	const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

	async function run() {
		const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  		const page = await browser.newPage();
  		await page.goto("https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/blog/");
  		
		// Get all blog title
  		const titles = await page.evaluate(() =>
		Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".post-feed .post-card"), (e) => ({
			blog: e.querySelector(".post-card-content .post-card-title a").innerText,
			}))
  		);
  	console.log(titles);
  	await browser.close();
	}

	run();



The rendered page queries all the H2 titles using the querySelectorAll method and displays the results as an object.

The result of running this script in the terminal looks like this:


List of article scraped from FreeCodeCamp using Puppeteer


The drawback of using Puppeteer is the slow performance and the time it takes on complex web pages.



As a rule of thumb, using a headless browser should be the last method when there’s no other way to access the data.
