L'Omo Morte is a distinctive silhouette on the Apuane Alps. Naturally there's a miserable, lovelorn legend attached to him. He gets a mention in the (very watchable) Spike Lee film "Miracle at St. Anna" as the Sleeping Man. People here now also prefer that name.

The first version is impressive, but it was lacking the distinctive paunch & big nose. Ok, I did ask.
