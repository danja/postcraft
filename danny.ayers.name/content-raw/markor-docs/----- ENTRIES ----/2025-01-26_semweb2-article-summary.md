*   **Web 2.0's Rise:** Web 2.0 has gained significant traction, becoming a major movement with many companies, investments, and publications focused on it. It has outpaced Semantic Web in both developer interest and successful applications.
*   **Web 2.0 Characteristics:** Web 2.0 applications often depend on a shared, flexible semantic model. They include mashups, blogs, wikis, feeds, tagging systems, and social networking. These applications are known for weaving together data, using collective intelligence, and addressing long-tail markets.
*   **Semantic Web's Vision:**  The Semantic Web shares some foundational ideas with Web 2.0, particularly around shared meaning, but has not seen the same level of adoption.
*   **Semantic Web and Web 2.0 Overlap:** A panel was convened to consider how Semantic Web capabilities can support Web 2.0's semantic requirements, enhance user ecosystems, and complement business models.
*  **Semantic Web Technologies:** Semantic Web technologies like RDF and OWL aren't widely used in Web 2.0 despite their capabilities. Web 2.0 favours technologies like RSS, AJAX and microformats. The formal logic of RDF and OWL is absent from Web 2.0.
*   **Semantic Web Value:** Semantic Web inference can improve tag systems, suggest links in blogs/wikis, and enhance search in social networks. However, there's a mismatch between Semantic Web's precision and the often imprecise data in Web 2.0 applications.
*   **User-Generated Content:** Web 2.0 applications rely on user participation for content creation and curation. This includes platforms like Wikipedia, Flickr, and eBay. The Semantic Web currently lacks practical ways for non-experts to manage and map changing ontologies.
*   **Ease of Use:** Developers often prioritize ease of use over semantic precision when creating Web 2.0 applications. RDF and OWL are considered difficult to learn and use compared to simpler methods like blogging or tagging. Software developers prefer XML or microformats over RDF/OWL.
*   **Web 2.0 Business Models:** Traditional Web companies focus on user transactions on their sites, using metrics such as stickiness and click-through rates. Web 2.0 uses a lighter business model, where users are both purchasers and contributors.
*   **Long-Tail Markets:** Web 2.0 companies often focus on serving smaller, niche markets that are not addressed by established businesses. They use scalable infrastructure and user-generated content to do so.
*   **Semantic Web's Advantage:** Semantic Web technology offers a unique benefit with its powerful query and reasoning capabilities for handling the complex data in user-generated systems.
*  **Semantic Web and Long-Tail:** The Semantic Web's ability to support sophisticated queries over dynamic content is a key advantage for long-tail Web businesses. The Semantic Web must be better, faster, or cheaper than other technologies to succeed.
