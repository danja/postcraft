Decompose, simplify - abstract

```prompt
I want to build an intelligent agent-based system for solving complex problems. A prerequisite is describing human problem-solving strategies in a formal, concise and unambiguous manner that can be used in LLM prompts. A key aspect will be simplification. I can think of two methods, I'd like to know what others might be worth exploring. The first is decomposition. It's an easy idea intuitively, but how can this be described in a form that makes it useful in procedure description? The second is abstraction - shifting to a higher conceptual level, finding commonalities for shared solutions plus discovering existing solutions by analogy, that are the same shape. Can you please explore these ideas, consider how they may be pinned down enough to create a requirements spec for agent characteristic and capabilities? It would also be useful to know what research has been done in this field, good keywords to use for web search.
