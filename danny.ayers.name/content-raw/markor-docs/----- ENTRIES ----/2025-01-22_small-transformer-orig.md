minimal low resource continuous learning transformer model architecture

A minimal low-resource continuous learning transformer model architecture can be designed by combining several efficiency-focused techniques:

## Lightweight Base Architecture

The foundation of the model should be a compact transformer architecture:

- Reduced embedding dimensions (e.g. 384 instead of 768)[2]
- Fewer attention heads (e.g. 4-6 instead of 8-12)[2][4]
- Shallower architecture with fewer layers (e.g. 5-6 layers)[2][4]
- Parameter sharing across layers to reduce total parameters[6]

## Efficient Attention Mechanisms

- Use lightweight attention variants like linear attention or performer attention[12]
- Implement sparse attention patterns to reduce computational complexity[12]

## Dynamic Expansion

- Employ a dynamic token expansion strategy to adapt to new tasks[4][7]
- Add small task-specific adapter modules instead of full fine-tuning[6]

## Continual Learning Techniques

- Utilize knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from previous tasks[6][7] 
- Implement memory replay with a small buffer of past examples[8]
- Use regularization techniques like elastic weight consolidation to prevent catastrophic forgetting[8]

## Optimization for Low-Resource Settings

- Quantization of model weights and activations[2]
- Pruning of less important connections[2]
- Mixed precision training and inference[12]

## Key Components

The core architecture could consist of:

1. A shared encoder with 5-6 lightweight self-attention blocks
2. A task-specific decoder with 1-2 task-attention blocks
3. Dynamic task tokens that expand as new tasks are learned
4. A small episodic memory buffer for replay
5. Knowledge distillation and regularization during training

This design aims to balance model capacity, efficiency, and continual learning capabilities for resource-constrained environments. The exact hyperparameters would need to be tuned based on the specific low-resource constraints and task requirements[1][3].
