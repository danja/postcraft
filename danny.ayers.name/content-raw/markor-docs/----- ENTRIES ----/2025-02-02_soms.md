Hierarchies of SOMs are sometimes used for classification tasks. A possible application of genetic algorithms (GAs) would be the evolution of those hierarchies as well as the filters used for data preprocessing. Finally, one of the most important open questions from the point of view of pure research as of applications is how network structures should be encoded in a genetic GA chromosome to attain a “creative” evolution process.
