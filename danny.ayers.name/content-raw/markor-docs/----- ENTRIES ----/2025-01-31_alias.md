# Duck Identification

I'm likely to need to support a bunch of different kinds of IRIs, URLs and quasi-URIs like filesystem refs that may be duplicated across systems. I know there are specs & vocabs  out there (ietf & w3c for starters), but I'm going to dodge this rabbithole for now. Making stuff up and aligning later is fine as long as things are reasonably scoped (the layers underneath aren't being broken).
