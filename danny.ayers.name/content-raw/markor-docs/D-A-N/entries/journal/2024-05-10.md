# Journal : 2024-05-10

Ok, for TODOs, I'll have a top-level `todo/index.md` file, plus monthly files like `todo/2024-05.md`. Then have **Plan** blocks in this journal for daily bits.

### Plan

#### Postcraft

- [*] :PostcraftPrep + tests, get it to rendering the individual post HTML adequately.
- [ ] :Unfork experiments

After several hours, I've managed to confuse myself...
I've been thinking about different ways of doing Postcraft transmission(s), roughly :

- three semi-independent pipelines defined in transmission.ttl : markdown -> HTML rawEntries; rawEntries -> entries; rawEntries -> front page
- one 'continuous', with an Unfork or some such to bring the control flow down to one path
- one more blocky, with ContentGroups being set up from manifest.ttl in ConfigMap at the start

All three approaches could be supported, but for now I should just pick the one that seems most suitable for the current task. Considerations :

- keeping it simple, with sensible defaults
- keeping concerns separate :
  - `transmission.ttl` = topology
  - `services.ttl` = details of individual service configurations
    together they define the application
  - `manifest.ttl` = application instance configuration

I need some fresh air.

#### FOAF-Archive

- [ ] Placeholders + manifest.ttl for FOAF-Archive
- [ ] FOAF video

#### Kaggle-Preferences

- [ ] get set up, run the demo
