What age difference is considered socially acceptable between partners in a romantic relationship?

This just crossed my mind for the 3rd time this month, a related paper [1] passing through my morning reading radar. 1st was meeting a woman I found very attractive, probably still in her 20s. 2nd, my birthday reminded me that I miss having a (human) partner.

Wikipedia [2] mentions "half your age plus 7", which bizarrely started as a goal rather than a filter. For me that produces a range of 38 - 108. I wouldn't be uncomfortable dropping a decade from the lower limit, several from the higher.
The diagram reminds me of the lightcone in the theories of relativity. What other frontiers should be added..?
