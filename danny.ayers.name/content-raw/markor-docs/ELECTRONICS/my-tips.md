Tips for broke students

u/B0NSA expressed bench envy, being a broke student. I've recently got myself pretty much equipped from for a second time from scratch, like a fool I got rid of everything when I moved to Italy.

My main advice - just be patient, if you're interested in this stuff, the workbench will come to you. My first bench was my bedroom floor at my parents'. (I did study electronics but drifted into coding for work-work).

Ok, tips:

* Clearly identify what you actually need

A coder's aphorism is 'You Ain't Gonna Need It' (YAGNI), when thinking about implementing something you might need in the future. That half-applies here. 
Two cases - 
Because I spend a lot of time with microcontrollers I paid a lot extra for a USB oscilloscope with 8 extra channels for logic analysis. Never used them.
But then the first soldering iron I got this time around was absolute low-end Amazon. Wasn't good in practice, broke after a couple of months. The one I have now is still budget Chinese, but has plenty of power, reasonable temp control, replacements tips are cheap & hot air is very nice to have, even if only for putting heat shrink on mains connectors.

* Breadboards

Get lots! You'll thank yourself. On the one hand, if you take a circuit so far and decide to leave it, if you can put where you got to on the shelf, you can always come back to it later (see note on components). Some bit of quick & dirty test gear for a one-off project - it's still there if you happen to need it later. 

* Soldering iron 

must-have, but even if you only expect to use it occasionally, get something capable that looks like it will last

* Power supply

you'll clearly need something, but

* Multimeter

* Oscilloscope

* Components

* Storage

* Ergonomics

* Notebook

* Signal generator

* Amplifier
