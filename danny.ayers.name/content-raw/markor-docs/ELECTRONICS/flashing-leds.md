This YouTube short that popped up has a nice lighting effect.

Had to watch a couple of times to figure it out. 
The LEDs do the flashing themselves. Seem like the ones listed as "5mm RGB flickering LED". 2 kinds available, slow & quick flash.
Module is a TP4056 charger for 18650 Li-ion. USB in, 4.2v out. New to me, look handy, cheap from Amazon. 
Circuit is a little bit iffy, the LEDs take 3-3.4v, 18650s are nominally 3.7v. Listing says those LEDs are 20mA each, so 24 in parallel, 480mA (except that bit of overvoltage will push it up).
The charger module has a bunch of protection built in, so it shouldn't burst into flame.
I just like the circle of lights effect ðŸ˜„
