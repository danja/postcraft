Based on the information gathered from various sources, here are several pieces of advice for amateur rock climbers over the age of 50, focusing mainly on increasing and maintaining muscle strength, along with brief mentions of optimal diet regimes and other influential factors.

### 1. **Exercise Regime:**
   - **Strength and Power Training:** It's advised to engage in 2-3 days per week of total body strength training, year-round. The intensity should be maintained throughout the year with regular and progressive overload being crucial. It's important to perform big exercises and lift heavy to elicit a hormonal response beneficial for muscle growth [➊](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/training-considerations-older-climbers/).
   - **Hangboard Training:** At least twice a week, you should do hangboard training to work on critical grip positions, particularly crimps and pockets, with each session lasting 15-20 minutes [➋](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/training-considerations-older-climbers/).
   - **Hard Bouldering:** It's recommended to have at least one intense and short bouldering session per week, year-round. During power phases, you may increase this to three sessions each week [➌](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/training-considerations-older-climbers/).
   - **Mobility Work:** A minimum of one 10-minute session of mobility work each day for every decade of life is advised to keep the body supple, focusing mainly on shoulders and hips [➍](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/training-considerations-older-climbers/).

### 2. **Muscle Recovery:**
   - **Recovery Weeks:** Every three to four weeks, it's beneficial to reduce the duration of workouts by about 50% to allow for muscle recovery [➎](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/training-considerations-older-climbers/).

### 3. **Diet:**
   - **High-Protein Diet:** A high-protein diet, potentially supplemented with a protein supplement if necessary, is recommended to support muscle growth and recovery [➏](https://www.strengthlog.com/building-muscle-after-50/#:~:text=A%20proven%20strength%20training%20program,enough%20from%20your%20regular%20meals).

### 4. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Weight Management:** Regular weight checks and maintaining a healthy weight is crucial as extra weight can make climbing harder and increase the risk of injury [➐](https://www.climbstrong.com/education-center/training-considerations-older-climbers/).
   - **Individual Adaptation:** The training plan may need to be adjusted based on individual factors such as susceptibility to injury, weight, and previous training experience [➑](https://www.climbing.com/skills/getting-older-heres-what-coach-says-to-do-to-keep-cranking/).

### 5. **Muscle Contraction Types:**
   - Research indicates that despite an overall decrease in muscular strength with age, older adults tend to maintain eccentric strength in greater proportions compared to isometric and concentric strength [➒](https://journals.aiac.org.au/index.php/IJKSS/article/view/6995#:~:text=Background%3A%20Despite%20an%20overall%20decrease,CON%20strength%20is%20relatively%20unknown). Therefore, including exercises that involve eccentric contractions could be beneficial.

### 6. **Time of Day:**
   - No specific information was found regarding the optimal time of day for training; however, consistency in training, regardless of the time of day, is a key factor in progressing in rock climbing and maintaining muscle strength.

This advice encapsulates a holistic approach towards maintaining and enhancing muscle strength, incorporating a balanced diet, and adjusting training regimes based on individual circumstances and recovery rates for amateur rock climbers over 50 years of age.
