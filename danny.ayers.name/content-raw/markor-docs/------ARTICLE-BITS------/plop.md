Flopped on the couch in front of the fire last night I stumbled on a node lib that pleases me greatly. It's a little node utility for generating boilerplate code/text. Pleasing because firstly, I have immediate uses. Secondly, it's one of those elegant little hacks that solves a recurring problem in a manner I for one would never have considered. Make a *generator* the single source of truth.

Use case : I have a boilerplate base system prompt for Claude AI projects. I frequently tweak it. I try to keep the latest version in a well-known location, but often forget to update it. Also project-specific edits are usually needed (s/act as an ontologist/act as a Swedish chef), but not really enough to justify spending time making a templater.
This thing sorts all that. 

A third pleasure, its generators are simple enough that an AI can generate them. Another little step towards meta-automation.

Finally, the most pleasing aspect of all, its name : "plop".
