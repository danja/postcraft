I want to make a hybrid musical instrument. Call it an eeebybow. It will be based on an electric guitar, output will be generated in the usual fashion from standard pickups. But the strings will be driven by a row of small solenoids, one per string. I'm thinking of making the solenoids by cutting an end off miniature audio transformers. These will be driven by cheap class d amplifier modules. Their input drive will largely come from the output from the guitar's pickups, in a feedback loop. Initially I would like to target a bowed instrument sound akin to a cello. 
For the feedback loop, I would like to send the guitar pickup's output through an adc into an esp32 microcontroller, then apply some dsp before sending the output to the solenoid. 
I will also start with 7 push switches that will go into the microcontroller. One will switch between settings and play mode. In play mode, 6 of the switches will be assigned per-string. An oled display will provide the rest of the UI.
I would like you now to do two tasks for me. First, write a systematic, step-by-step construction plan for a first prototype, including any trial experiments I should do along the way.
The second task is to consider the dsp requirements. There will be a combined output from the guitar pickups as input, which may lead to certain challenges. Also, it will be desirable to use a digital output pin of the esp32 for drive signal. I don't know whether it will be better to use a direct square or pulse drive at the target frequencies (which will initially be unknown) or some kind of pwm-based dac. Please consider the viability of these and any other options. The hardware design should be such that it enables easy experimentation with different approach, with minimal modifications. 
When using the play keys, I imagine that to start vibration, some kind of impulse or burst will have to be sent to the corresponding string, before a feedback loop is initiated. Please think about potential strategies here.
