it may come with a standard adjustment - however action is a personal thing - decided upon based on the strings of your preference, your preferred relief and your playing style (e.g. light or hard). Gibson gives specifications for the setup at delivery. And mind thay have the ‘Plek’ machine for clever adjustment of relief.

David from Gibson setup says:

‘To check neck relief: fret the low E at the first and 15th fret (not 12th) reach to the 7th fret and tap string. There should be a small space between string and fret - no thicker than a piece of paper. Do the same with the high E. ACTION: fret low E at first fret and measure the distance from the bottom of the to the top of the 15th fret. It should be 5/64". Do the same with the high E, measurement should be 3/64". Now measure the string height at the nut; underside of the string to the top of the fret. Low E and A should measure 2/64", D and G =1.5/64" and B and high E = 1/64". If string height at nut is correct, recheck string height at 12th fret with strings open. Measurement for low and high E's should be the same as measurement taken at the 15th
