I'm slipping from my blog-first intention by posting this here, but my setup isn't ready yet, and I reckon Monica Anderson's dev stack post will help me a lot, so I'm behoved (is that a word?).

I've currently got a load of stuff on the go concurrently. It's all very interrelated, but easier to manage as separate projects/repos. 

With the AI setup, I've spent a lot of time (as I go along) trying to optimise thing. It has massively boosted my productivity 

This last month I've shifted from mostly using Cursor (hooked to OpenAI API), to three separate editors open: 
1. Cursor, for the hands-on coding, on whichever single repo I'm focused on; 
2. a VSCode, with all repos under dev; 
3. An instance of Pulsar (formerly Atom) I'm in the process of customising, currently pointing to all the docs (symlinked from the repos).

But spending a lot of time jumping between Claude in a browser and the other spaces (CLINE sounds great).
