I'm thinking of a pseudo-campaign (I don't intend putting any effort into it) to encourage people to post their thoughts in their own, ideally self-hosted space first, before passing on to the social media platforms. So they can control their material and not be at the whim of any secret algorithms.
The best name I have so far is "homepage first". Can you think of anything better, or give suitable slogans and branding suggestions (a badge or whatever)?

Before social media.
