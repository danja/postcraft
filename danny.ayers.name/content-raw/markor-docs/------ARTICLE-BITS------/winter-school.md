Strongly recommended. 

I watched a lot of the presentations last year, very stimulating. 

Beforehand, looking at titles, I expected a lot of overlap in material. But there was such a variety of approaches to a diverse range of problems, it was a real overload of new ideas.

In areas where I had some prior knowledge, the directions in which people were taking things made a lot of sense. But even there I picked up a lot that had never occurred to me. 

Very friendly folks, helpful and patient with my barrages in the Q&As.
