I had a wonderful Xmas dinner up at Mari's with friends, now back home. I'm stuffed, could easily put a rubbish film on and doze on the couch in front of the fire. But urge to do /something/. Holidays, so it has to be fun, low priority, low thought, finishable quickly. I've narrowed it down to 2 activities, both have products I *really* want... about to flip a coin. 

But fun, survey - which would you go for:

Heads : "99" - a synth module using 2 cheapo delay effects modules. All planned. Needs a little bit of front panel work, straightforward op amp design & wiring.

Tails : "Sheltopusik" - a toy language needs Promises resolving. Minimal, Lisp-like with JSON syntax, primary use experimenting with my pipeliney project. Claude's done the grunt work, but he got stuck on trivial-for-humans conceptual layering.

Took me a while to find a coin to suitably reflect the weight of the decision. A mangled 1912 ha'penny. 
George says "99".
