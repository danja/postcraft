Create a single panel comic-style photorealistic  image with a vertical thermometer gauge on the left side, mounted with metal brackets. The background is cream colored. From top to bottom, show exactly five positions of a fluffy black and white cat:
1. Top: Cat completely limp and elongated, drooping over an invisible shelf
2. Second: Cat stretched out but alert, triangular ears visible, tail extended straight
3. Middle: Cat in sphinx position, sitting upright with curved tail
4. Fourth: Cat curled in a C-shape, eyes closed
5. Bottom: Cat compressed into a perfect ball shape

The thermometer should have a red mercury column and bulb. Title below reads 'THERMOMETER FOR CAT OWNERS' in capital letters. The cat images should be photorealistic, the rest can be minimal.
