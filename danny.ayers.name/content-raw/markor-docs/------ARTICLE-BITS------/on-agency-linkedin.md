This is great. A persona is how an entity presents itself to the outside world. There are many aspects to this, starting with communication abilities and typically governed by role. Paz mentions needs, capabilities, and objectives. 

Although superficially it seems like anthropomorphism, I've arrived at the same pattern coming from the direction of system modeling. For shorthand I'll point to FOAF profiles - an identified entity has a bunch of associated characteristics. Some of those may be typical of humans, others might be typical of software. 

A fundamental consideration is how we define "agent", there's an ambiguity. One way is as a person or entity that acts on someone's behalf (call this weak agency). This clearly covers many scenarios for exploiting AI. But the other definition, an agent as an entity that acts, has much greater potential (call this strong agency).

I'm leaning towards a model in which *anything* can have a persona, personality even. Take a rock for example. It won't have very interesting scores on the Myers-Briggs personality test, but it will have a geo location. However you measure it, it's agency and autonomy will be limited. But it will have affordances, it can be thrown at things. This can be viewed as weak agency.
