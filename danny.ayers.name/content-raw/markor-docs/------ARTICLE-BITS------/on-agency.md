I reckon the core idea here is spot on. 

needs, capabilities, and objectives

I haven't a clue about UX but have arrived at essentially the same pattern from a different direction (system modeling).

On a superficial level, because LLM chatbots quack like humans, it makes sense to interact with them in a similar manner. But I'd argue it'll be useful to go much deeper. 

A fundamental consideration is how we define "agent", there's an ambiguity. One way is as a person or entity that acts on someone's behalf. This clearly covers many scenarios for exploiting AI. But the other definition, an agent as an entity that acts, has much greater potential.

A person's characteristics include autonomous agency, knowledge and skills and the ability to communicate with others. The current generation of AI agents are very limited in terms of their agency... But this is bound to change.

LLM-backed chatbots do nudge us towards anthropomorphism way beyond the reality of the systems. But this doesn't negate the value of thinking in terms of personas. A persona is how an entity presents itself to the rest of the world. It has aspects tied to its role in a given environment, and that role in turn is tied to knowledge and capabilities.
This might sound mad, but 

A rock, null hypothesis
