I was tickled to find this in my email inbox. I didn't write the paper, but you can't imagine the temptation to claim it. (I must get sausages in my portfolio somehow...).

Years back, in the blogocene era, when Web 2.0 was the Next Big Thing, I would often ego-search, put my own name in Google. It was really handy for discovering material that interested me. What had happened was that that I had a blog of my own, and frequently commented on other peoples'. 

Before the "nofollow" mechanism came along, and before Google their algorithm from PageRank to BeEvil, I was top hit for "Danny" for quite a while.
 
Initially there weren't many other folks with the same name as me visible on the web. I'm pretty sure none would show up on Google Scholar. Now we're 10 a penny.

Blogging really was big before the mass extinction event caused by the devastating impact of Facebook. Fortunately a handful of little bloggers survived and evolved into cyberfowl (or were already there, Shelley). 
We are among you still!
