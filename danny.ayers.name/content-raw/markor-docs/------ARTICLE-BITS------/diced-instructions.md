# Getting Things Diced/ Sliced & diced

TL;Dr : a systematic time management system with dice and human intelligence

Do you think you might benefit from a personal assistant or a motivation coach? Here's a free alternative. 

This is a very simple, low-effort, zero-commitment, practical technique intended to help overcome procrastination and increase productivity. It works through psychological tricks.

At minimum, all you need is a pen and paper, a pair of dice (or appropriate substitute [link]) 
## Executive Summary

1. an *annotated* todo list is created
2. a *constrained* selection of these items is chosen and ordered systematically (slicing)
3. a weighted *probabilistic* decision mechanism is used to determine the next task (dicing)
4. productive *action* is taken

## Materials

* Two dice
* Task Pool sheet(s)
* Dicing sheet(s)
* Timer

Pen & paper are fine for the sheets, although laminated sheets [link] psychological trick pseudo-commitment
Similarly a clock is fine but a dedicated timer is another trick.

**NB.** While the dice may be substituted with a different random number generator, this technique takes advantage of the *non-random distribution*  of the sum of two dice.
