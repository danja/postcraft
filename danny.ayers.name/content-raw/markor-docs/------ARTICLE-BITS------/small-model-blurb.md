From mistral's site :

Used in conjunction with larger language models such as Mistral Large, les Ministraux are also efficient intermediaries for function-calling in multi-step agentic workflows. They can be tuned to handle input parsing, task routing, and calling APIs based on user intent across multiple contexts at extremely low latency and cost.
