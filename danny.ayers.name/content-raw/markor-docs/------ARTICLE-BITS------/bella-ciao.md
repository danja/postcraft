Bella Ciao!
An interesting article for historians (social and war), musicologists, and anyone who likes a good tune.

I'll be grateful to anyone that could explain a particular aspect to me : the current perception of the song in Italy.  

I only really got to know about the song a few years ago. A little surprising, because I the melody was very familiar and I've often associated with active anti-fascists (back when I used to have a social life :)

Out of curiosity, I brought it up a few times in conversation with locals. My Italian is embarrassingly bad, it was clear there were a lot of subtleties I wasn't understanding. But the gist of what I got was that Bella Ciao was frowned on by many people because of its adoption by political groups considered far-left. 

It's likely an after-the-fact association, but nowadays the song is seen as an anthem of resistance, dedicated to the partisans. So surely, the message ascribed to the song is one that *everyone* (except neonazis) could get behind..?

Ok, that is what I would have naively assumed before having spent some time here. I can't remotely claim to have a good understanding even now, but I do know that there are significant factors that, as a non-native, I wasn't aware of.
One key point I reckon, is that historic fascism is generally perceived differently in Italy than in the UK. Brits say "Mussolini made the trains run on time" with heavy sarcasm. But I think it's reasonable for me to say, here you find quite a lot of genuine appreciation for the things his regime did. Undeniably Italy was in dire straits in the early 20th, the dictatorship was seen as bringing in changes that raised a lot of people out of poverty. But of course both the British and Italians were subject to massive propaganda. A good while after WWII I personally grew up thinking of Mussolini as the ridiculous buffoon sidekick to Hitler, the devil incarnate. But as well as being a deluded, cruel, arrogant bully, he was also a great self-publicist. The idea of him as a champion of the common people, master of efficiency and saviour of the nation, has to some extent stuck. Anyway, irrespective of whether or not Mussolini was responsible for any actual positive change (in reality, apparently he didn't do much for the trains), I reckon these perceptions are relevant in attitudes towards 'Bella Ciao'.
  
*However*, after saying all that, the people I talked to about Bella Ciao aren't random samples of the Italian public. Garfagnana was on the Gothic Line in the war, with much fighting between the fascists (largely under German command) and their opponents (largely under US command).

Around here, there was no question about who were the baddies. For starters, serious building work was done on fortifications using forced Italian labour. (A twist is that a division of African-American Buffalo Soldiers were deployed here, who would have been descended from slaves over there). The Germans were ruthless and murderous towards the locals, exemplified by the massacre of a village's whole population, just over the mountains in Sant'Anna di Stazzema (as featured in the Spike Lee film 'Miracle at St. Anna').
