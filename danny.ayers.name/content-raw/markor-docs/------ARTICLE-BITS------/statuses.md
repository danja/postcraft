What a great question!

Tracking the status of in-progress modules with short, descriptive labels can be super helpful. Since you lack test coverage, it's essential to have a vocabulary that's easy to understand and communicate. Here's a suggested set of short terms you can use to label your modules:

1. **WIP** (Work In Progress): Indicates that the module is being actively developed or updated.
2. **BROKEN** (Broken): The module doesn't work as intended and needs to be fixed.
3. **PARTIAL** (Partially Working): The module has some functionality, but it's not fully complete or working as expected.
4. **STUB** (Stub): A minimal implementation that provides a basic structure, but lacks significant functionality.
5. **INCOMPLETE** (Incomplete): The module is missing critical features or functionality.
6. **UNTESTED** (Untested): The module has no automated tests, making it difficult to determine its functionality or reliability.
7. **WORKING** (Working): The module is fully functional and meets its intended requirements.
8. **DEPRECATED** (Deprecated): The module is no longer maintained or supported, and its use is discouraged.
9. **NEEDS REVIEW** (Needs Review): The module requires a thorough review to ensure it meets the project's standards and best practices.
10. **WAITING ON** (Waiting On): The module is dependent on another module or feature being completed before it can be fully developed.

Feel free to modify or add to this list as needed to fit your project's specific requirements. You can also use these labels in combination with each other to provide more context. For example, "PARTIAL BROKEN" or "WORKING UNTESTED".

Remember to communicate these labels clearly with your team and stakeholders to ensure everyone is on the same page. This will help you prioritize your work, identify areas that need attention, and make informed decisions about which modules to focus on next.
