The aim is to create knowledge representations involving overlays of mappings involving vector embeddings and RDF descriptions, contained in a sparql store, to allow a kind of "pan and zoom" (film analogy) across a corpus that might cover a variety of domains. The corpus will be heterogenous in terms of content, eg. academic papers, blog posts, short fragments of text, pieces of code and turtle. Summarisation and chunking will be needed. The result will be used alongside llms and sparql to provide rag and fine-tuning datasets.
Please review your project knowledge and derive a system involving the community detection from LGDE, with domain-specific terms mapped into RDF. A hybrid similarity measure is desirable, one aspect being locality in the derived RDF model and another a semantic similarity measure use faiss tools.
Describe the necessary components of the system and the data flow.
