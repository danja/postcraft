Food for thought on a Sunday night 

AI will replace traditional internet search…

When you are searching, you’re typically looking for answers.. AI will help prevent you hunting around on web forums that match your search criteria  for what you are looking for.

As AI advances and LLMs become more real-time, traditional search will be dead.

Correct me if I’m wrong. Let me know your thoughts…

Me : 

Yup, the days are numbered for search in its current form. The whole activity of getting/working with information is at the start of a major revolution.
I reckon there's something about search's history that's worth bearing in mind. Google's PageRank was a *useful* breakthrough, but other, intentionally skewed, ranking algorithms started developing around the same time. Google itself is much less useful these days as it values advertisers way more than end users. 
There's a similar risk with AI tools. 
But I'm generally optimistic. I reckon the tech is in a position comparable to when timbl came up with the Web. An open, free-ish global system had certain advantages over trad desktop/LAN docs & data, domination by the likes of IBM, Sun & MS.
Now we have Meta, OpenAI etc trying to dominate the markets in a similar fashion. But again, driven by already-outdated commercial strategies, they're competing in the wrong race. Right now the open source/research side of things has a lot of momentum. Systems designed to be useful rather than motivated by the $ have a slight edge again. [TODO edit, s/to be useful/ for inherent value]


I might well be wrong, but I think we're in for some serious *positive* upheaval in the near future - mostly coming from the grassroots.  
Btw, for things like coding etc I'm already using AI at least as much as until very recently I used search (Claude Projects are my current meta-workhorses, with Codeium+VSCode & Cursor+OpenAI for the details, some of my own tooling gradually creeping into my workflow). For non-worky stuff, I try my best guess at which will be quickest, search or AI, is a bit of a toss-up.
