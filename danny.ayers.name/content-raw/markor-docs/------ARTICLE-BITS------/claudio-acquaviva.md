I hadn't tried Claudio in a Halloween costume before. Dunno, he's not into toys like most dogs, I kinda assumed he'd not be into dressing up either. But this time around had to try, see how he felt, you never know.

But what? I couldn't think of anything he might enjoy. Ok... famous Claudios? I could only think of Claude Lorraine the painter, who I only really know of because i inherited a couple of his prints, no idea what he looked like. Emperor Claudius, obviously. But a toga?! It's like the worst horny undergraduate party thing. The boy's celibate for heaven's sake.

Searchy searchy...yay!! Claudio Acquaviva, the 16th century Jesuit priest. How could I have forgotten him? Perfect.

So I spent hours making  the square biretta hat. 
Tried it on. Claudio singularly uninspired.

But then - he reimagined it - he was Marianne, icon of the French revolution!

Boys will be...
Next year he will definitely be Derek Jacobi's "I, Claudius".
