I would like to use some computers on my home LAN to host a web site and other services, on a couple of other ports. I would also like to use wake-on-lan.  I believe this can be achieved through port forwarding. The Lan is connected to the internet through a tp-link wr841n router to my service provider. I have a remote server permanently connected to the internet at 178.79.189.240. That has nginx installed for web hosting there, and to proxy to other services. This is available if it might help the setup. All computers are running a recent version of ubuntu. If there are any open source tools that might help, please let me know. This will be a low volume, small scale, one-off setup which will be used by two or three people, nothing fancy.
The local computers use the router gateway at 192.168.0.1. The router wan is currently is set to dynamic IP,  gateway at 192.168.8.2.
Please provide me with step-by-step instructions for how I can fulfill the requirements on this setup.

Please write the code for a simple nodejs service that will use express as a web server on port 3770 and provide a html button, with necessary js, that will send a wol call to the computer on my lan at ip 192.168.0.10.
