The machines should keep working without me.

Genetic algorithms - different for different layers (biome, person, society, species...)

#:Todo identify Genome/phenomes

#:Todo #:transmissions analyse layering/abstraction

Separation dimensions

Code inside a Processor

Processors 

Transmissions 

#:Todo think about topologies, relations other than connection a -> b

Routemasters on the radio - get from one Wikipedia page to another only by clicking links in pages

We are at inflection point where AI breakthroughs are fundamentally changing the way we work and live,”

Other constructs at the same kind of level as processor

,  structures other/representations other than graphs

Patchbay - has processors on X & y, plugs to connect

#:Todo go from vector dB to node values - synthesize to fill in holes -unembedding 

If a (new) doc or whatever can be generate from the vector, going that way, vectors can be genes

Mutation, crossover and merging algorithms - evolvable

Generation algorithms - evolvable

Set of evaluation agents -also evolvable

--> two  nodes corresponding to two docs, point halfway in between. 

Generation - random letters get embedding
