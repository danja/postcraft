Enough to demo something end-to-end

For a funding proposal - initially a year, 3 monthly reviews.
Looking for funding, investment.

I have spent years on requirement gathering

The proposal is itself a demo - have a hosted service with an  Kia community, agency

Pivot - terms for next steps, prep resources that may be needed later

Diverging from yagni to ymni ("yomni") - a small job now might make things easier in future. In real world we do this all the time, but yagni is more reliable. But with improving abilities in prediction, calculating probabilities, these are back on the table.

Describe a requirement, let Kia fulfil it.

First target - harden existing stuff, evaluation, identify useful use cases, targets. Low-Hanging fruit.

EU, academia or industry - but the core systems must remain open source.

Self-sustaining somehow?

Spawn other initiatives, eg. Elfquake
Simplify r & d
Rad

Layered, low-code etc

Looking for funding - pay me full time and a part time assistant. (Bergi or a grad student). Consultants as needed - code review, sanity checking - danbri, Libby, reto..?
Researcher..?

Provisionally, have done coincident with spooky-pivot, but no fixed deadline.

Poc demos - PV:goals - some term for success conditions
