Text editor - need to select, highlight paragraph-ish sized blocks and move them around. 

A scrollbar-like interface would be useful, click on that to copy & paste.

Multiple windows with the whole setup persisted as a kind of project. 

Auto-hideable clipboards

Chunk IDs, a la zigzag?

Implementation - would be most convenient inside pulsar, but as a standalone single-page-ish web app would be nice. PWA on mobile.
