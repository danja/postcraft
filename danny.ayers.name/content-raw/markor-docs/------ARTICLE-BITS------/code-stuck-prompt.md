Magic Prompt for coding!

For a couple of days I'd been trying to solve an issue with my code and Claud and ChatGPT always messed the code even more and I knew it had to be something simple or at least no as complicated as how they tried to fix the issue. So I created this prompt to get out of the nonsense loop and works like magic!

*Evaluate each aspect of the solution with these key questions:*

1. *Does the analysis directly address the problem?*
2. *Were all possible causes considered, or are there unassessed factors?*
3. *Is this the simplest and most direct solution?*
4. *Is it feasible in terms of resources and costs?*
5. *Will the solution have the expected impact, and is it sustainable?*
6. *Are there ways to simplify or improve the solution?*
7. *What are the essential requirements versus those that are just a plus?*
8. *Show me the minimal reproducible example.*
9. *What edge cases should we consider?*
10. *What testing approach would validate this solution?*

*If you identify ambiguities, suggest clarifying questions and, if possible, offer improvement alternatives.*

I hope it may help some of you, happy prompting!

EDIT: I added some more questions, thanks to u/themoregames
