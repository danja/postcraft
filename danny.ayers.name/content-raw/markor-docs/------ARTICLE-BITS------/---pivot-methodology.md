# The Pivot Method

A productivity system for the 21st C

Pivots are the engines of positive change

Gather taglines ^^^

Make every task information-gathering, increase the knowledge pool

Zoom levels on knowledge relevance

Brainstorming

Derive direction guide from personal, first-person notes - need a word, snippets, gems, snacks..?
Use to guide build  collation systems

Exploit impulses (check for similar things in neurodiversity literature)

The pivot system is an agency, a cooperating community of agents to help get things done

---
Book - main chunk is the same, but have different targets :

Pivot for software engineers

For homeworkers, students...

Pivot for scientists

Pivot for musicians...

Different tag lines

Lumpy agile. 

Animation system for generating video tutorials - that are interactive! Periodically ask questions, encourage involvement to boost engagement

Gamification

Pivots are like milestones, deadlines etc. At a pivot a Great Reset is carried out. The parameters are normalised to the current state of the system

The system should evolve, especially in terms of personalisation for the user

Every task should increase knowledge and productivity

Reduce the overhead of automation

Exponential, not linear progress, acceleration - result of feedback

Consider chaos theory, attractors

// I need a way of discovering the most relevant papers on a given topic and condensing them - prompts! Corpus building.  STRANDZ

Useful approaches get boosted

Check material from anthropic etc

The first rule of the pivot methods is that rules will change

Automate asap, flywheels

Build analytics in everything from day one

Engineer for flexibility

Include randomness by design, probabilistic decision making

Genetic algorithm to change analytics, algorithms, formulas

Serendipity

Aspire to only do any task once

How to estimate the cost of automating?

Dogfood

Spikes - need a way of judging random ideas, howuch time to devote

Tentacles - reaching out to explore new directions

Thing crosses mind 3 times, do it!

Identify tasks that are repeated

Note everything down, even just a word 

Fast search for a noted thing, easy to add +1 to boost priority



Continually build knowledgebase

Will this help?

Virtuous cycle, collect info - especially for ai training

Feedback

Test approaches

Optimise

Iterate, tune, hone tools

- workshop analogies?

Measure monitor

AUTOMATIC REMINDERS!!!
