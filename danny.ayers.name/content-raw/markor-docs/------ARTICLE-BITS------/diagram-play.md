Please create a mobile-friendly application using html, CSS and vanilla JavaScript that will allow users to create flowcharts. The flowchart will be rendered in the top of the window, the UI in the bottom. There will be buttons to add new elements such as process steps and conditionals, together with their labels.


I would like an application where a user can input steps to a process and the application would generate a process flow. The application would trigger the creation of the flowchart once the user inputs "Finish".  Make sure the flowchart uses colored boxed with rounded corners.  Build it all using html, css and javascript in one html file.
