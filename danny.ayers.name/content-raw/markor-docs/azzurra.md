Unexpected good news! Looks like there's someone to rent No.7. Very funny what just happened.

Claudio got me out of bed because there was someone to see me. It was Manuela with a young woman and man. The woman interested in the house. She gave me little hug when we met, which seemed a little od. But she was very attractive, so I wasn't going to complain.
I got the key, showed them around. Manuela mentioned things from the past, she and Caroline were friends. My mother got to know her too.
Anyway, just now. I'm still really tired, didn't really understand what Manuela was talking about. The woman seemed interested in the place. I said 300/m, the first thing that came into my head. Ok.
Then we were exchanging contact details. I said, "sorry, I didn't catch your name.". "I'm Azzurra". She and Manuela gave me funny looks. Manuela said, "it's Azzurra...My daughter, Azzurra!". I know her! I've known her for about 20 years!! It's just that last time I knowingly met her, she was a little girl. Now she's a grown woman.
If I remember correctly, she's been to my mother's house! Years back my mother invited Manuela

I am so sorry about not knowing who you were right away. My excuse is that I'm really tired after travel, but the real reason is that I'm an idiot!
I did think it was a little odd you gave me a hug when we met. But it's not often I get hugged by stunningly beautiful young women, so I wasn't going to complain.

(I am really tired from the UK visit, it was very intense. I'm ok emotionally, but my brain is fried from the stress)
