 I've had intermittent, mild, flu-like symptoms for a few months. But it's followed a new kind of diagnostic procedure, hardly involving my GP. Series of tests, analysis by and discussion between me and ChatGPT, sanity-checking by Marinella. 

I reckon the 3-way process between patient, human expert and AI has been very efficient. ChatGPT's interpretation of test results seems accurate, though its diagnoses have been overly open-ended. At one point, among it's many suggestions was HIV. Ok, patient lifestyle said unlikely, but expert rejected it immediately due to the lymphocyte ratios.

But most of the exploration was done in patient/AI interaction, not the expert's time, a limiting factor. Much more ground was covered than would be feasible in GP appointments.
Work has been done on engendering bedside manner. In this scenario a short patient questionnaire + a form for the GP could probably target well. With a big LLM like ChatGPT it's in prompt engineering scope. Whatever's down the line for more specialist systems, already there is huge potential for making better use of GPs' skills.

So I'm just back from a blood test for leptospirosis. Whether or not cursed rodents caused my issue remains to be seen. But it is a distinct possibility that wouldn't have surfaced yet, were it not for AI.
