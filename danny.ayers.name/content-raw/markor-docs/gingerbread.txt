Expedition "Christmas cookies

To Aiko Bunny, Baby Roo and all the brave little men with big dreams.


Every morning, even before the sun rises, the aroma of fresh bread wafts from the bakery on our street.

Street lamps illuminate the frozen sidewalks, the air is icy and stinging, and shaggy rednecks tap their feet by the sweaty, glowing windows of the bakery. Do you see the bakers Ronja and Martin? They love to make bread and sweets, and their magical Christmas cookies are famous throughout the city. Already at the beginning of December, the orders for the Christmas goodies start pouring in. The sweets are prepared according to an old family recipe by the grandmother of the two bakers.

Ronia is very patient and organized. She gets up early and starts preparing the baking trays, Writes down the ingredients on the board, cuts the dough, beaters and rolling pins and waits for Martin to mix the dough, Martin is chaotic and distracted, but don't be fooled by the fact that he is sleepy. He makes sure that the heavy sack of flour is delivered to the bakery every morning and has the responsible task of filling

the stocks of magical spices needed for warming sweets. Here he is - he burst into the quiet pastry shop panting and grinning.

Ronya looked at the recipe on the board and continued to order: - We will need cinnamon!

- Ginger! - Martin joined in.

And a pinch of cloves! Ready! Let's mix the dough! The two each took a wooden stirrer and began to mix the ingredients. They loaded the trays and turned on the oven. Their cookies tasted really magical because it was their grandmother's recipe. Of course, they shared it with us, because grandmother's recipes should be shared.

RECIPE FOR CHRISTMAS COOKIES

We will need:

125 grams of soft butter, 100 grams of brown sugar, 125 grams of honey, 1 yolk, 1 tablespoon! baking soda, 375 grams of flour, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ginger, 1 teaspoon of cloves.

Let's mix the dough!

Beat the butter with the sugar. Add honey, yolk, flour, soda and Christmas cookies. Knead everything, then wrap the dough in transparent kitchen foil and leave it in the refrigerator for half an hour. Then we have to roll it out to a thickness of 5 millimeters and cut the cookies with molds. Place in a tray, on baking paper, and put the tray in an oven heated to 180 degrees. Bake the cookies until golden and leave them alone to cool.

If you wish, you can mix in a white glaze

100 grams of powdered sugar to decorate the cooled bisque Bumku.

As soon as the first egg is knocked, a song is heard throughout the bakery. With it, the dough becomes smooth and the cookies are baked perfectly! It's very helpful to sing to yourself while mixing Christmas Biscuit Mix!

The oven chimed and the bakers began to bring out the trays of hot Christmas cookies.

- Ah, how good it smells! Ronya clapped her hands. Martin rushed to fetch the round boxes of

the dried lids. - They need to cool down first! Ronya interrupted him. -

Arrange the cookies carefully so they don't break. - Yes, yes, carefully like with Christmas toys...

The two bakers lined up the treats in the boxes, and each full box received a kanak u ce nogpe, waiting on top of the previous one. Ready deliveries towered over the bakery counter. Ronya stopped at one of the cookies

and frowned:

- Look at this man! Its buttons are crooked and the frosting has spread! It doesn't work! Martin looked at him from all sides and added:

I like it! It has everything, it's simple

a little different...

And put the little man in the box.

- No! Ronya interrupted him.

- Well, what did this Biskẞumko do to you!

And it has secret spices, and it smells like Christmas like the rest!

No no no! We'll get a complaint and no one will order any more of our cookies! Throw it away! It will stay for me!

I already said! - Ronya took it and threw it in the bucket.

She tracked the orders and checked all the orders on the list. Put the last box of cookies on

He reached the top of the pyramid and crossed his arms in satisfaction.

He reached the top of the pyramid and crossed his arms in satisfaction.

We made it just in time! We can go for

gocmabkume.

Martin put on his coat. Then he opened the door, but quickly closed it again because she flew into the bakery

such a whirlwind that the floor was covered with snowflakes.

- Wow, what a blizzard it is outside!

Right now? Ronya couldn't believe her eyes.

- Martin looked with admiration through the window.

- It is very beautiful!

Very beautiful?! And how will we distribute the orders? - Ronya already

was pacing around the bakery in silent terror.

Martin thought as she fidgeted beside him.

We can dress very thickly and wrap the kymuume

a blanket…” he began.

we are lost!

- A blanket?! Can't you see how scary it is outside? End! for-

- Then let's wait for the storm to pass and then we'll bring biskvumkume!

Ronya sat despairingly on the flour chest. I need a cup of soothing kakaot

A moment! - shouted Martin and immediately mixed cocoa according to another special grandmother's recipe. He handed the glass to Ronya, she smiled tiredly, wrapped her arms around it and drank. The warmth of the chocolate embraced her and she Sighed

-No way. We'll be delivering the cookie boxes in the morning. Toka Va will at least be light. Come on, it's time for a break. Ronja and Martin cleared the bakery, took down the zonlapokume

aprons, turned off the lights, went up the stairs and went to sleep. And just when everything in the bakery became quiet, which for garbage seemed to come to life, began to sway, then the swaying increased, and finally the trash fell and became louder. From there came Biscuitko - the defective biscuit man. It stood up, stomped

from the flour and looked around

- Wow! I got out of the bucket! Alone! I'm very strong On the hanger, next to the trash can, hung a zombapcka nec tilka. The Biscuit Man jumped up, climbed on it and sat on the chair, stood with legs apart, took hold of a wooden stirrer and began to sing at the top of his voice

I'm Cookie

the brave man. I came out of a stove alone, but I'll go far.

I will escape from the bakery, I will rush through the city, I will go around the world And I will come back home.

Izvedny, a strange creature appeared on the table. His body dewe om pokoxdamka for hot tabbies, and his feet were of cups for kakve. His eyes and nose were made of a piece of cloth sewn over the burnt places in the handles, and above them protruded a fork and spoon from a salad set. It sounded a lot like Los -Nice song! Lost said

From Good day!! - jumped up

Bucksumko

- I'm not so sure it's a good day!

- Snow storm!? Great! Let's go out and see! - under no circumstances! My grandmother used to tell me how in a terrible blizzard she went outside... and no one saw her again. A kak mu zo e pazkazala, as no one saw her again? - Biscuitko was surprised.

There's a snowstorm outside!

Losm looked at him embarrassed, then indignantly

- the important thing is that it's cold and scary outside

- It's not scary outside at all! Let's go out yes

finally shot:

We see how cold it is!

- Absurd! Lost jumped up

- Well, look out the window! Look how much snow there is, I can't wait to get out! Come on! Adventures await us, of which

it will make your hair stand on end! - Oh, no, no, no! I don't get goosebumps at all! I am very cold I cannot walk in such a storm for no reason! In order to go outside, I have to... I have to have a purpose!

- goal? Good! Now I'll think of a purpose for you... I'll think of so many reasons that... Cookie was pacing up and down the table, and Losm

Cookie and the Moose started doing exercises. This included climbing shelves, running on a tray, push-ups with a stirrer, sit-ups on the handle of an oven and massage with a ka-grinder... Finally, tired and satisfied, they stood on the table, They felt ce kamo cynepzepou,

Let's go! - Biscuitko shouted solemnly - Just to get my scarf! Because if I catch a cold, I'm going to sneeze, and did I sneeze...

-Yes, yes, I know, you will get sick!

The moose went for a scarf, and BiskBumko sat on the edge of the table. In this

for a moment something at the window stirred and a lithe shadow slid into the darkness. She wrapped herself quietly around Biscuits

- What are you doing? - gently ponuma

the shadow.

- Oh, that startled me! Who are you?

- I'm a fox, don't you see? - she answered him and her muzzle

slowly came into the light.

The fox was actually a window sealer made of woolen cloth. She stretched and in the light of the window appeared the long and toned figure in a shot

- Ah, but here it smells of biskvimku! -

exclaimed the Fox.

- Yes! All the boxes are full of Christmas cookies. Now we will deliver the orders!!! Biscuitko proudly explained.

- You smell delicious too!

- Well, because I'm biskvumka.

- And you're not in a box?

- I am defective...

- Oh, looking at you, I'm getting hungry! - the Fox approached Biscuits.

- ...Because my buttons are crooked and my frosting has spread! That's why... - the little man continued to explain.

"I don't hear anything because I'm hungry," Lissa interrupted. - Please get on my tail so I can hear you better. Biscuit looked at her and thought, “Poor Fox! She does not

listen!" and then said:

- I don't get up to eat! Dont you see? - Oh, I can't see anything from hunger! Come a little closer!

I'm defective and I'm not fit to eat!!! - cried Biscuitko. - Ayy, how can you talk like that?! - scolded the Fox. - You are one well-baked biscuit man! Well, you're a bit of a wimp!

- Ah, no, I've already trained! I am very strong! - Wait until I take a good look at you!

shen voice:

The fox circled Cookie once more, measured his Height, then measured how far he could open his mouth. He grew stronger, and just as he was about to eat it, something rattled in the bakery, and from the dark shelves of spices, straw burned.

21

Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! No one will eat Cookie! Who was that? - the Fox started.

Buuuuhahahahaha! I am the Keeper of the Bakery! From the darkness of the shelves flew a large tin grater with two jar lids for eyes and two slotted spoons for wings, its beak a spoon and its legs made of forks. It looked quite like an owl. The owl spread its wings over the Fox's head and landed menacingly against her. He squeaked like a true knight, and after a kpamka struggle the Fox retreated into the darkness with nogßuma onawka.

22.
At that moment the Moose appeared and called out

-I'm ready! Let's go, BuckBunko

-Boohoo, boohoo! Buchalt cleared his throat

- Buk kak swelled up! Told me he falls asleep very quickly

Suck8umko!

- I'm not Biscuitko! I'm owling because I'm an owl!

-A, koge e buckBumko?

- Here I am! - popped out from behind the tower om kyuu Buckumko Thanks for saving me from the Fox! I'm Cookie, the brave man.

-Yes-yes, I heard your whole song. I'm Buchhalt

- We are going on an expedition! - boasted Cookie -Hue -I want to come with you too! - the Owl's eyes lit up.

- It's cold and scary outside, it's important to know

Lost

- Super-shouted Buhalt. - I really like it to be scary

23

Cookie, Moose and Owl started loading the Christmas boxes onto the flour crate. It took them out of-

a time to arrange them firmly and safely, but soon they were

ready and set off on an expedition in the blizzard. - We're out! cried the terrified Moose, when they came out into the street.

- Quieter! You'll wake everyone up! - screeched the Owl. This is our first adventure! - he looked around with admiration

Cookie. - Isn't it Exciting?

"Actually, it's not that cold and scary," muttered the Moose

- Takaaaa, ga Bidim for where is the first dostabka..... As always at such moments, a song began to sound in the air...

We are on an expedition

In front of them appeared a large box with the holy translation pok riboti was covered with a thick layer of suque. The three of you are welcome to the Entrance Spama u SuckiBunko is rolling - This is where our first delivery will be

- I knew it was dangerous outside! - mumbled the Moose softly. - Do not worry! We're going to dig a tunnel and save cookies-me

! - said the little man and began to row with his hands. - Stop now! cried the Owl. - The snow will make your hands soft!

- How are we going to dig a tunnel then?! muttered Lossom.

The three friends sat under the street lamp and thought. Suddenly Cookie and the Owl looked at each other with a smile and ce

turned to Losa:

- You will dig the tunnel! - jumped the little man cheerfully. - My horns are perfect for this job! - added the Owl. -Ahh, the snow is very cold. I do not want!

26
- No, I'm not waiting, we have a mission! Biskvumko replied matter-of-factly. The elk gasped and stuck an antlered spoon into the prispa, and then with

- First you have to break it with the fork, and then toast it with the popcorn) - corrected BickBumko.

Lossum glared at him and snorted angrily, but continued to row, Buchalt brightening so that Losst could row on- Into the snow pile, and Biskvumko nogchopping from foot to foot and encouraging the workers. They advanced slowly, but a very strong tunnel was obtained.

Done! - shouted Biscuitko and rushed to the boxes. The friends took a stab at the load of cookies and started

to take them to a safe place.

- Hooray! Shipments are saved! - shouted Biscuitko.

- How are we going to deliver a box to this house? asked Lossam.

Cookie and the Owl looked at each other and smiled... - Aaaah, no, this time it won't be me! - Losut hastened to add. - You took off with the box and dropped it in place. I will make you-

I'm leaving. Buchalt grabbed the box and with a creaking sound rose above the precipice. A little left! Stop! Sooooo right! Stop! Now up!

Careful! Now slow forward!

At that moment the ribbon on the box was untied and pramka-

she stomped on top of the snow chamber.

- Oh no! - Shouted the Moose. - I knew it, I knew it!

- Take it easy! - answered Biscuitko. - Owl, pick me up! Buchalt lifted him above the snow and stood over the box. Biscuitko swayed and nudged her towards the entrance of the house. The parcel soooo slid down the slope of the precipice and stopped right at the threshold. The three heroes waved their hands and shouted:

- Hooray!

- Cookie Box Number One has been delivered! - noted the man in the list. - On to the next house!

The city quietly sleeps in the frosty night, we will add coziness for luxury. Cookies in a box from our warehouse next to your cup of hot chocolate.

As the melody died down, the Christmas troupe disappeared into the snow towards the next houses that awaited the magical treats.

During this time, however, a silent shadow watched over everything from the bakery window. Yes, it was the Fox, who smoothly descended through the open door and followed them.

30
The characters reached a large house with Christmas lights around the windows. In front of the big house was an even bigger puddle of ice. After a short discussion and several unsuccessful attempts to overcome the obstacle, the friends decided that Biscuitko should carry the box to the door, because only his feet did not stick to the ice. Well, of course, there were some funny Vania slips, somersaults and a penguin flight, but Biscuits successfully coped with this package too.

- Shipment number two is in place! - Buchhalt was happy and marked this on the list.

The song kept playing and our heroes moved on. The fox ran after them and missed them

followed.

31

We are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!

The tower of boxes was shrinking, and the Christmas cookies were reaching their recipients. The heroes felt proud and happy about the accomplishment of the important task, despite the slight fatigue. They approached the next house, but could not omkpuam omkode to enter. As they circled her, the Moose's antlers rattled against the fence posts. When they finally found the door to the yard and opened it, a huge dog house appeared in front of them. The friends looked at each other for a moment and

They shouted in unison:

Eng

They slammed the gate, dropped the delivery in the mailbox outside the House, and hurried on.

I don't understand why there are such huge and scary dogs in the yards?! muttered the Moose. Buhu, dogs aren't scary, they're just at work - no-

explained the Owl.

- A dog?! - Biscuit was puzzled. - What a dog, there was only a dog house.

Well, ga ge, what's a scary watchdog for you? - okonumu ce Lost. - You can just put a huge and scary dog house in the yard, and let us imagine the rest of the scary. That way we will be both afraid and safe.

The three of them giggled and continued down the snowy sidewalk. Come on friends! We have a few more boxes. Let's go

to the next street! - shouted the biscuit cho-Veche enthusiastically and ticked off another delivery on the list.

The fox was slipping into the dark alleys of the rue Ste and was not far behind the Christmas expedition, Aroman tut of cookies stopped her in front of the front door and she opened it slowly. When the huge and scary Dog House stood before her, the Fox quickly closed the gate and ran after the Christmas characters. Hmmm, no need for a scary dog, the shack is enough.

Cookie, Moose, and Buckhalt had already covered the crate with Boxes in front of the next house. In this pre-Christmas snowstorm, the heroes managed to cope with a variety of challenges. They delivered cookies to the second floor with the help of a beke from space, Made a ball of Christmas lights 8 QUN 2800 Sneak between thorn bushes and jumped over white bars but no matter what happened, they managed to continue the expedition. The moose grew less and less afraid, Buhalt more and more squeaky, and Biscuitko jumped up and down in delight and sang his first song.

The fox watched as the three friends left a box of cookies in front of each house and growled softly. She was trying both to catch up with them and to remain unnoticed. She shot at every delivery on the doorstep, but someone always scooped up the treats right under her nose. The checkered stalker became angry and her tail suddenly electrified.

- Ah, I was already very angry! Finally, I'll catch Biscuit! And I eat it! - hissed the Fox and rushed to catch up with the expedition. During this time, our heroes had stopped to rest under the last street lamp of the city. will

- Only one delivery left. It's for the house at the end of the forest - said Biscuitko and pointed in the dark in front of them. Ah, we didn't understand about any forest - the Moose stepped back.

- We cannot miss even one house, no matter where it is! - replied the Owl.

Cookie nodded with a smile and sang:

- Do you remember?! Our goal is clear! "Every Christmas for-

it must be wonderful!" - But it's dark and foggy there. We might get lost. -

The moose was ready to come back. The owl looked at him with wide eyes:

- Buhu, please, please, let's not be offended! If only I decide, and the dark will light up like an amusement park! - The Owl's eyes lit up and he turned his gaze towards the forest. - Let's go!

36

The friends stepped into the deep snow and began to go around trees and bushes, and in the distance the windows of the last house shone. They were already quite tired and slowly dragged the crate on which the last box of Christmas biscuits was sitting.

-I can not see! - Losm grumbled again. We're almost there! - shouted Biscuits, heading for the house.

Biscuit sped forward into the blizzard. The trees bent and the wind whistled in their branches. The biscuit cho- Already seems to have melted into the forest. The owl tried to shine in his nocoka, but finally lost sight of him. Then he huddled around the Moose and with joint efforts they managed to return the antlers to their place. Well, almost in his place. They began to walk slowly through the storm and call Biscuitko. Onumbaxa ce ga caught up with him, but the snowdrifts did not help them at all.
At that moment the Moose tripped in a clearing and one of his antlers fell off. The hero stood up with a groan

- Onaaa... - whispered Biscuit.

- What happened? Lossam was horrified.

- Well, kak ga mu say... - began the Owl.

- Did I get sick? - Losum got fed up.

- Ah, no, no, you have nothing... And one of your horns is missing... - Here! I knew it! I knew it was dangerous in the forest! Oh, now

I will faint!

The moose swayed and carefully laid down in the snow.

Wow!...

What are we going to do? - Biscuitko hesitated for the first time. - I guess we should go back!

No way! - the Owl stopped him. - You take the last delivery and I'll handle the horned incident. We'll catch up with you! Good! I'm leaving!

39
But the Fox had whistled and tossed him around like a tasty biscuit toy. And maybe when she opened her mouth wide and swallowed it, a terrible forest monster appeared from the forest with a roar and a crash. His body was made of leaves and branches, instead of a head he had a twisted nest with protruding feathers, his hands reached the ground and were made of pine bark, and his feet were made of giant pine cones, and with a creaking, they left two slow tracks in the snow. The monster furiously вύρου κ the Fox. A noisy struggle ensued. Lisha was throwing and writing, and the monster was bellowing loudly, sneezes fearfully, screamed horrifyingly. In the commotion that ensued, Biscuit managed to hide behind the crate, and the monster chased the Fox kow appena..


- I said no one would eat Biscuit! - it roared and sneezed fearfully at the running Fox. Then he added: - Here, I knew

Biscuit appeared from behind the crate and timidly ponuma:

- Moose?

I'm going to get sick now...

Then the forest beast sneezed again and collapsed. Of course it was the Moose and the Owl! They rushed to Biskvumko.

"Are you okay?" they called me in unison.

- Friends, you were scary! We arrived just in time to make the last gocmaßka!

The heroes hugged each other and solemnly received the last Christmas gift.

They left the box in front of the door, rang the bell and hid behind a large snow bush. The door of the house opened and two hands came in. The "Christmas Bisquimku" expedition was successfully completed! The company got excited, shouted "hooray!", but very quietly, and the heroes set off tiredly to the bakery. On the way, exhausted but happy, they recalled different moments of their unforgettable adventure. They laughed, rolled around in the snow and ate an ice pod and a snow monka each so they wouldn't be sick anymore. They came out of the forest, passed through the quiet streets of the city and imperceptibly approached the cozy bakery. The door quietly ombopu u me sank into its warm home. The windows darkened and the characters fell asleep.

In the morning, the snowstorm had passed, the sun was peeking through the window, and Ronya and Martin were getting ready for work. The new snowflakes were piled up on the street like glittering hills, the footsteps of passers-by crunched on the pavement, and shaggy rednecks hopped in the tracks and chirped happily.

- It is very beautiful! Ronya sighed as she watched through the window.

Martin looked thoughtfully at the bakery counter. The boxes of biskvumku were missing, and the list noted that all deliveries had been received.

- All orders are from

Martin smiled and added with relief: - But I think I remember who did all the work At the table - tired but happy - snorted Cookie, the Moose and the Owl. Ronia and Martin looked at each other. Suddenly they realized that this little Bisquime man had led a brave expedition into the snowstorm to bring joy to everyone in town.
