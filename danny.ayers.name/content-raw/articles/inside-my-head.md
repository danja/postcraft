# Inside My Head

*I intend to do a proper write-up of this sometime soon FOOTNOTE. But due to my mother's ill health I'm likely to have to spend some time in the UK in the near future, with interactions with people that don't know me that well, so I'll get key points down now to save wasting everyone's time on in-person explanations.*

I FN was recently formally diagnosed with adult ADHD. It explains *a lot*. My life has been strongly impacted by traits that were generally put down to personality (even by me). In the past I have been diagnosed with well-known mental health conditions : anxiety (major), depression (minor) and alcoholism (chronic). Several times I've tried various standard treatments to alleviate these, without significant results. In recent years, more through luck than judgement, through a combination of environmental changes LINK and largely informal help, the negative effects have been reduced. It's become increasingly apparent that the primary root cause of these problems was the ADHD. The bad bits are common comorbidities.

Before continuing, there a few things *everyone* should know about ADHD :

* It is real (see below)
* It is not an illness or disability in itself
* What most people think they know about it, including a lot of medical professionals, is just plain **wrong** (in no small part due to the acronym being misleading)
* It affects different people in different ways
