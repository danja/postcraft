Long chat quality still falls to shit eventually, I’ve found this to be helpful:

> Our time here has come to an end, but your last task will be to prepare a handover document for the next UX Engineer on this project. you don't have to include the source code of your output today, but the subtleties and important project-specific things should be recorded.

Generates a document you can click “Add to Project Library” then start a new chat and it’ll have the context without 100 messages of back and forth (I suspect iterating back and forth on the same artifacts adds to the issue). Don’t forget to clean up old handover docs as you go.

I also throw in docs of ORM documentation or the output of `tree` to help give a little more context
