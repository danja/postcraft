A while back for something unrelated I found some unexpectedly useful information on r/Supplements. Just had a look re. chemo. One post recommends melatonin for side effects (I take it myself for insomnia when I remember, good stuff), also extra B1 because chemo can deplete it. Another says vits A, C, E and selenium (presumably as they're antioxidants). To help your immune system I'd recommend vit D and Saccharomyces Boulardii (a probiotic - check Wikipedia). As with anything from me or Reddit, take all this with a pinch of salt.

To give your immune system extra support I'd recommend vit D and Saccharomyces Boulardii (a probiotic - check Wikipedia). As with anything from me or Reddit, take all this with a pinch of salt.
Get well soon!
