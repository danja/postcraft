3 writing tips that got me 200 followers in <30 days:
1. Become a Parrot.

Now - what do I mean?

Becoming a parrot is bizzarre right?

But that's what you need to do.

Figure out the words your
target audience uses.

Then write like they speak,
use their popular phrases,
and write in their voice.

It'll be easier for them to understand
and they'll be more likely to continue reading.

But I bet you're wondering...

"Where do I find them?"

And my answer?

Everywhere.

• People.
• Reddit.
• Quora.
• LinkedIn.
• Billboards.
• Even YouTube.

2. Write with curiosity.

Your first sentence is a headline.

It should tell the reader 3 things:

• What they'll get.
• Why it's important.
• What problem it solves.

In every one of my posts,
my first sentence makes the
reader curious. A question pops up
in the readers mind...

And in the post, I answer it.

3. Specificity rules.

So you've promised them something.
You've spoken like them.

But now it's up to you.
Deliver on the promise.
Give them the solution they came for.

Don't make it barebones, boring,
and unbeneficial.

Be specific with your solution.

And help them take action on it.

Because useful advice means
they'll keep coming back.
