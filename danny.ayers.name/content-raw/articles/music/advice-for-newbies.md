Some say the music industry is dead then make YouTube videos for musicians telling them how to win in a dead industry.  Fact:  the music industry is a multi billion dollar business.  It has reset but not to the advantage of musicians.  Not surprising because it was always like that.  
It is very important if you commit your life to a career as a music artist, that is a writer, composer or performer to pick a competent trustworthy management team.  A mistake here is ruinous as in, it will destroy your chance of having long term success whatever or however promising the short term wins.   
How do you make that choice count?  Ideas?

### Don 'Bigd' Swensen :

"The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs" - Hunter S Thompson

### Phil Valenti :

Start your own music publishing company. Own everything you write.
Get a young manager. A beginner that needs your success.
If youâ€™re a performer be prepared to tour.

### Me :

I very much like Phil's suggestions.

To which I'd add: document and publish your progress in every available medium. Share links on all social platforms.

Firstly, this gives you some immediate exposure. Blogging is great for maintaining a single source of (your own) truth, noting your thoughts and jotting down useful links etc. Over time it can act both as a reference and give you a sense of progress.

Music platforms like SoundCloud incline you towards home recording, any experience with that is useful (and money-saving).

YouTube skills are a must-have these days for anyone wanting to do public-facing creativity. End-product music videos are an obvious target, but I reckon things like autobiographical, tutorial material and any random stuff that crosses your mind are worth doing too.

I'd strongly recommend a publish and be damned attitude. By which I mostly mean, don't feel insecure about putting stuff out that isn't to the standard to which you aspire. The act of publishing/broadcasting *anything* in itself will boost your confidence (NB. remember even negative comments are engagement, which is positive).

It is bound to be dreadfully slow at first, but you will also be accumulating an audience and useful contacts along the way.

If further down the road you decide to hide the content you're not satisfied with, you have that option. But I reckon having a trail behind will make you more interesting to people, help you stand out. An individual story is appealing to everyone.

PS. Frame your own narrative.
