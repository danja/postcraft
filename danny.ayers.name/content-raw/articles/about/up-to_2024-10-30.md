I asked Claude :

> What is the toki pona "pali wan, kama pini tu." in English?

 > The Toki Pona phrase "pali wan, kama pini tu." can be translated to English as:
 "Do one task, finish two."
 This phrase uses the following Toki Pona words:
 pali: work, do, make
 wan: one
 kama: to become, to arrive, to bring about
 pini: end, finish, complete
 tu: two
 The meaning conveys the idea of efficiency or accomplishing more than expected - by doing one task, you end up completing two things. It's similar to the English saying "killing two birds with one stone."
