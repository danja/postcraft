# CV bits for Leonardo

## Background

I studied Electronics (for the music industry) and later Engineering IT.

## Experience



I worked on support at a college for 7 years. End-user and network, we were very understaffed so I had to do a bit of everything. My boss, who was meant to look after the system was also in charge of the IT for management and finances, so I ended up doing most of the sysadmin. This was a long time ago : half the network ran Netware when I left, one job I was setting up email accounts for the staff. In most cases, their first.

But I did start learning about the Internet.

Hosts
