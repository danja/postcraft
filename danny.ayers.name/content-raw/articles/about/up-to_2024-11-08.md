# What am I up to..?

*Everything around here is __Under Construction__*

## Work-ish

I spend most of my desk time on research & development (this rarely translates directly into income for me, and this stuff is also a hobby for me, hence the *"-ish"*). My recent focus has been around finding ways of making the best use of AI. Predictable in 2024, but I'm not exactly new to this game.   

The documentation for what follows is all *in-progress*, as is the system for managing that documentation. Everything is [deeply intertwingled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity).

For want of a better place to start... Along with a handful of other things, I am *definitely* committed to the following :

0. Creating an environment (real & virtual) that keeps me happy
1. Creating a retrospective of the [FOAF Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF)
2. Documenting and otherwise contributing to [RDF-Ext](https://rdf-ext.org)
3. Creating an earthquake prediction & early warning system
4. Creating societies of diverse autonomous agents

About a year or so ago my server was compromised, which prompted me to take a *big* step back and reevaluate the way I was doing *everything*. Call it the **Great Reboot**.

The things I've been working on recently are among the consequences of a pathological [yak shaver](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/yak-shaving) attempting to fulfill these commitments.
Key components, what I've mostly been active on recently :

* **hyperdata.it** - an umbrella for most of this stuff, the knowledgebase
* **Transmissions** - a mini-framework for data processing pipelines
* **UM** (*Unnamed Methodology*) - a revision of Agile, devops in a post-LLM world
* **Farelo** - tools for helping *get things done*

### hyperdata.it

I have found the RDF model an exceptionally good basis for knowledge representation, likewise SPARQL stores as knowledgebase containers. The overarching advantage is that they are Web-native, by default compatible with the greatest knowledgebase humanity has built.

I got a long way with building quasi-dedicated interfaces to common stores....
