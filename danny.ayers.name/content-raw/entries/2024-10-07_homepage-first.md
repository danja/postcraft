# Homepage[^1] First

*I'll use this post as my sample for This Site Requires below*

I don't think I've written this down anywhere yet, although the core idea certainly isn't new [^2].

Instead of automatically posting material to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.., post it in a space you control first. Only then share any of **your own content** on the big $-motivated platforms. And only share as little or as much as you want to, on a case-by-case basis. Copy & paste everything, get AI to write a summary, only post a link. **Your choice**.

But I've still not adopted the principle (? better word?) myself, despite having the provider of what you're looking at under my own control (cheapo quasi-bare metal virtual server, nginx and a bunch of node code). Aside from the elephant in the cyberspace that this site ain't much to look at (*yet!*), there are some key elements I need to work on a bit first :

## This Site Requires

* **Accessibility** - firstly in the broadest sense, presenting this stuff in a form that will work ok for most people on common devices. But high on the list are using some of the techniques of [Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) to remove tech obstacles that might limit the potential audience.
* **Modalities** - other aspects of the same kind of thing, focusing on supporting multiple devices, multiple media. I don't yet have a workflow for easily publishing video & audio *Homepage First*. Very low-hanging fruit in this domain is giving the site a feed : Atom format first (because I was on the WG, I think it's the only RFC with my name in it).
* **SEO (Ho-ho-ho)** - page metadata, rich snippety things, so that links posted to the platforms, search results etc. have a decent preview

I'm framing **Homepage First** as a (lazy[^3]) campaign. I'll do a proper *launch* when I've got my systems set up to capture comments etc. (This will be lazy[^3] again - I'll just post a link here and there. I've given myself an artificial deadline of 2024-10-31 for announcing the release of a load of *unfinished* work, I'll chuck this in).

### Footlings

[1^]: 'Homepage' was best *(but still not great)* signifier for the space I could come up with was 'Homepage'. I bet the proportion of people that knows what that means has actually *declined* over the past 20 years.

[2^]: Related material will appear around here soon. I currently have documenting specific bits of history (**#:FOAF!**) as a priority job. But the whole *milieu-milieu* around trends in social media, the Web and tech at large and the status of **Open Social** (as a good-enough umbrella term) is due a revisit, so my todo list is a bit broader.  

[^3]: I do have strong views on quite a lot of things, but simply can't be bothered doing much beyond living my life the way I do, occasionally stating my position and/or trolling on Twitter. Passive-activism (including inacto-pacifism). Also **I dislike the term 'hacktivism'**. In the current socio-politico-economic climate, hacking (in every sense except the nasty rip-off stuff) is inherently a form of activism. Fixing your own music system, making your own gadgets, all are a form of non-violent direct action. (For great ideas about creating your own future, check Libby's recent post : [Poking holes in reality with prototypes](https://planb.nicecupoftea.org/2024/08/26/poking-holes-in-reality-with-prototypes/)).
Oh yeah, I also dislike **'upcycling'**. Ok, the principle sounds ok - recycling and adding value (eg. environmental or artistic). But if you're making something, using recycled materials and being environment-friendly should be the defaults, not **virtue-signaling nonsense** over using a feather to repaint an ugly plain vase to make it an uglier decorated vase.
Oh yeah, and **'proactive'**, what is that beyond management babble meaning **active**. Ok, like 'hacktivism' and 'upcycling' I suppose it has value in **wankiness-signalling**.
