# Hiding Jacket

13:00

It's gone cool. I have a fleece jacket that's warm, but I knew it needed washing. So I just searched high & low, only to find it in the washing machine. A wash I did a couple of days ago and completely forgot.

My priorities today are something like :

- pension docs
- pulsar
- form-a-matic
- xmpp
- sidebars
- tidy desk
- fix chairs
- metal detector
- music room

But I've still got a bit of task paralysis. #ADHD Strategy : either do something that will help productivity or something that will benefit someone else or take Claudio out.

The #Pulsar thing is productivity and should be a quicky.

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/pulsar$ node -v
v20.11.0
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/pulsar$ nvm use
Found '/home/danny/github-danny/pulsar/.nvmrc' with version <16>
Now using node v16.20.2 (npm v8.19.4)
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/pulsar$ node -v
v16.20.2
```

New to me, [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) :

Trying :

```bash
corepack enable
git submodule init && git submodule update
yarn install
yarn build
yarn build:apm
yarn start
```

Some dependency warnings for `install`

Taking its time...might as well do printer alignment (I put in a new ink cartridge the other day before going out, alignment step had timed out before I got back).

Yay! Pulsar worked.

TODO review my earlier Pulsar tweaks, maybe integrate, save as `hkms-desktop`

TODO have a look at making an AppImage of `hkms-desktop`

What I want this for, in the first instance, is as a text editor for my #Postcraft instances, to free up this VSCode for, errm, code (I have been coding in Cursor, which is based on VSCode, but having this one separate to try other AI assistants will be useful).

I want the edity bits of each Postcraft instance in a common place. Named symlinks first :

```bash
mkdir ~/workspaces_hkms-desktop
cd ~/workspaces_hkms-desktop
mkdir postcrafts-raw
cd postcrafts-raw
ln -s ~/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/content-raw ./danny.ayers.name
ln -s ~/github-danny/hyperdata/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./hyperdata
ln -s ~/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./transmissions
ln -s ~/github-danny/foaf-retro/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./foaf-retro
```

Hmm. Most of the others need their folder structure updating. I'll sort those out as I need them.

Ok, this will need tweaks, but that's basically done :

![Screenshot of Pulsar for editing](media/images/2024-09/pulsar.png)

Font size changed 16->14.

```bash
cd ../transmissions/
./trans postcraft ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

TODO bash script to run transmissions on postcrafts

Bum. I left a bug in there. Sort out later.

Git commit & push everything.

TODO better way of doing git commit/push on all these (instead of from inside VSCode)

Dogwalk time.
