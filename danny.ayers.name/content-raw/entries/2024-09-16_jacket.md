# Hiding Jacket

13:00

It's gone cool. I have a fleece jacket that's warm, but I knew it needed washing. So I just searched high & low, only to find it in the washing machine. A wash I did a couple of days ago and completely forgot.

My priorities today are something like :

- pension docs
- pulsar
- form-a-matic
- xmpp
- sidebars
- tidy desk
- fix chairs
- metal detector
- music room
- PS. read @iand's notes around [Serverless: why microfunctions > microservices](https://blog.iandavis.com/2017/10/microfunctions/)
- foaf-retro todos

But I've still got a bit of task paralysis. #ADHD Strategy : either do something that will help productivity or something that will benefit someone else or take Claudio out.

The #Pulsar thing is productivity and should be a quicky.

Just thinking about Transmissions dev.

## Pulsar Install

https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking/#building-pulsar

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/pulsar$ node -v
v20.11.0
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/pulsar$ nvm use
Found '/home/danny/github-danny/pulsar/.nvmrc' with version <16>
Now using node v16.20.2 (npm v8.19.4)
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/pulsar$ node -v
v16.20.2
```

New to me, [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) :

Trying :

```bash
corepack enable
git submodule init && git submodule update
yarn install
yarn build
yarn build:apm
yarn start
```

Some dependency warnings for `install`

Taking its time...might as well do printer alignment (I put in a new ink cartridge the other day before going out, alignment step had timed out before I got back).

Yay! Pulsar worked.

TODO review my earlier Pulsar tweaks, maybe integrate, save as `hkms-desktop`

TODO have a look at making an AppImage of `hkms-desktop`

What I want this for, in the first instance, is as a text editor for my #Postcraft instances, to free up this VSCode for, errm, code (I have been coding in Cursor, which is based on VSCode, but having this one separate to try other AI assistants will be useful).

I want the edity bits of each Postcraft instance in a common place. Named symlinks first :

```bash
mkdir ~/workspaces_hkms-desktop
cd ~/workspaces_hkms-desktop
mkdir postcrafts-raw
cd postcrafts-raw
ln -s ~/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/content-raw ./danny.ayers.name
ln -s ~/github-danny/hyperdata/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./hyperdata
ln -s ~/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./transmissions
ln -s ~/github-danny/foaf-retro/docs/postcraft/content-raw ./foaf-retro
```

Hmm. Most of the others need their folder structure updating. I'll sort those out as I need them.

Ok, this will need tweaks, but that's basically done :

![Screenshot of Pulsar for editing](media/images/2024-09/pulsar.png)

Font size changed 16->14.

```bash
cd ../transmissions/
./trans postcraft ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

TODO bash script to run transmissions on postcrafts

Bum. I left a bug in there. Sort out later.

Git commit & push everything.

TODO better way of doing git commit/push on all these (instead of from inside VSCode)

Dogwalk time.

> (use `usr/local/bin`...) Alternatively, if you want the scripts to be available only for your user:
>
> Create a bin directory in your home folder if it doesn't exist: mkdir -p ~/bin
> Add this line to your .bashrc file: export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
> Reload your .bashrc: source ~/.bashrc
> Place your scripts in ~/bin

I need a `hyperdata-static-2024` repo.

```bash
cd ~/github-danny/pulsar

repopack --verbose -c /home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/repopack.config.json
```

That got stuck.

Hmm. `npm update repopack` stuck too. Network glitching? Yup, connection had dropped.

TODO minimalist hardcoded runner script for Transmissions to help testing & AI assistant generation

Something like :

```javascript
const servicesConfigA = {...}
const servicesConfigB = {...}

var message = {...}

// need to add
const A = new ServiceA(servicesConfigA, configType="json")
const B = new ServiceB(servicesConfigB, configType="json")

message = A.execute(message)
message = B.execute(message)

console.log(JSON.stringify(message))

```

I've made another repopack config, so :

```bash
cd ~/github-danny/pulsar
repopack --verbose -c ./repopack.config.json
```

Hmm. 9x too big for Claude.

Time to organise my scripts. Might as well put them on GitHub and on hyperdata.it

Added to `.bashrc` :

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/github-danny/hyperdata.it/scripts:$PATH"
```

then :

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

I did a repopack of the `src` and `docs` dirs of Pulsar. Docs was 58% of Claude project space, so I'll leave that there for now.

The Transmissions bug was an easy fix.

19:38 - food time.
