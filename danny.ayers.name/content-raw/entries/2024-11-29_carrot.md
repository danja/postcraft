# Carrot

*In bed activity this morning was developing terms for the #:rpp ontology to cover incentives : carrot & stick.*

The past week or so I've' a flurry of "new" (sub)projects added to my ToDos. Not exactly new, because they slot nicely into what I have already, but it is a good reminder that I need to nudge on my #:farelo project management bits. Prioritization for productivity, innit.

High on that todo subgraph is capturing project info using #:fam, HTML-form based entry (with auto-generated forms). But deciding which fields to focus on first is tricky. Need more data to inform...

So, #:paliwan, *pali wan, kama pini tu*, is write some things - from one-line todos to project-level bits down in plain markdown, once I have a few, ask Claude to translate into RDF using #:rpp vocab (later, ask for a script to do the translation automatically - would be a good mini-app for testing a small LLM in #:transmissions).

For now I'll put material under `/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/farelo/articles/rpp-md`
