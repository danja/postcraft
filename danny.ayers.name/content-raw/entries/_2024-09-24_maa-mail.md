Mozz gossip : Pier-Ugo has left Tiziana (dunno when, Mari mentioned it today when we were talking about Verbo the cat).

Brighter out today. I was helping Mari painting a ceiling yesterday, totally wore myself out.

I had a routine psychiatrist visit a couple of weeks ago. I mentioned how stressed I'd got on the UK trips, she prescribed me an SSRI for anxiety.

Not good. My anxiety hasn't been a problem under normal circumstances recently, so I was a bit skeptical. But it seems worse than useless. This drug seems to be massively amplifying the distractibility/unfocus side of adhd, very annoying and is making me anxious because I'm not getting round to various things (including $-related) I _must_ do. I'm going to start coming off it today.
