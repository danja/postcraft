# Misty

*It was very misty this afternoon for dogwalk*

I've a misty head today, now to ramble a bit to see what condenses.

Nice reminder, #:todo #:squirt handle images etc.

It also reminded me of the name of Led Zep's [Misty Mountain Hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6M3YQ_EF2E), but I couldn't think why that might stick in my head until I had a listen. I really like that "**dog dog dog, doggy dog dog...**". I bet I've already played with it somewhere, but I haven't a clue where.

This leads straight to my **misty memory**. My memory for day-to-day things is pretty lousy, main workaround being written reminders, lists and lists and lists... But I've actually got an exceptionally good memory for things around tech and suchlike, *in a sense*. Like, the capacity and retention of system ideas is really good, but the connectivity between them is poor, retrieval can often be hopeless. (This is almost certainly an #:adhd thing).

One specific issue comes up regularly. If I've got a plan for something worked out, but haven't been active on it for a little while, I forget which bits I've done. Very often I imagine I've implemented something I haven't even started, but that's not a major problem, because at that point I'll have a pretty good idea of how to do it. A fun, kind-of example of this is a (probably false) memory I have, of having a dream where I was playing the guitar chords to "Wild Thing" before I'd learned them. Following day I could play it.
I strongly suspect this is a false memory because at the time it would have been [Hendrix's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVN8_7wVSG0) I'd have had most exposure to, and the version I learned in the dream was open G-C-D-C-G chords on a nylon-strung acoustic, rather different. *The [Goodies version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zN2wWGbGyM) is quite a thing, though the classic [Troggs version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSWInYFVksg) would be my go-to these days. Now where did I leave that ocarina..?*  

The converse of this is a relatively minor problem, but one that's incredibly annoying when it happens. I forget I've implemented something and proceed to implement it again. Like buying eggs & potatoes when you've already got a larder full of eggs & potatoes. Except they can go into extra *tortillas espa√±olas*.   

## Actionable : Docs!

Ah...ok, something has condensed. Sort out project docs. The #:postcraft doc rendering bits are still fresh in my head, this would be a good opportunity. I did a #:transmission a while back to pull a list of my [GitHub repos](https://github.com/danja?tab=repositories). My plan then was to have it pull the `README.md` for each, use those to bootstrap docs. Slight snag, few had a worthwhile readme, certainly not up-to-date.

But I should be able to identify the currently active repos (they'll be a bit tangled up in Claude projects too - I've quite a lot there yet to find a proper home). There's my starting point. Writing some readmes should give me good anchor points from which to bootstrap the rest.

First though, a dogwalk in the dark.
