# Sunny Day

*It's a sunny Sunday day.*

My must-dos for today are plumbing. Actual plumbing :

* Sealant on leaky pipe at No.7
* Fix the *second* hole I hadn't seen under the sink here at #:New place

I also really need to make a start on some tree removal while the weather's dry. Stretching the notion of plumbing, first I need to sort out climbing gear, ropes, pulleys etc.

Financial plumbing, I need to sort a stack of papers, find the relevant forms I have somewhere, to sort out pension flow from Derbyshire County Council. I had a small (but very useful) monthly sum coming from there. Caroline worked at a DCC special needs place for a few years, I inherited her pension. It stalled a couple of months ago, I missed some kind of update step. I did do a little towards sorting it out, in the process discovered that I'm probably due some funds from the years I worked at High Peak College.

Software plumbing...things to join together. Separate posts here for them.
