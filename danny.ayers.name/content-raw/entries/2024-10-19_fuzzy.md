# Fuzzy

My head's a bit fuzzy this morning. I've a vague memory of coughing a lot in the night, my lungs don't feel 100%. Smoking too much plus wet weather.

#:next postcrafts - make a combined runner so all instances get rendered to where I want them (locally)

#:next
#:next #:fam move it along a bit

## Server

My notes about #:postcraft deployment etc should go under `~/github-danny/server`, but apparently I haven't got a postcraft instance there. Which is kinda convenient, I'll set that up. Being empty it'll make a good starting point for the rest.

#:todo add comments to these, it'll help with figuring out automation

1. copy `postcraft/postcraft-template` to `server/docs/postcraft`

2. add symlink for #:hyperdata-desktop

```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces$ ln -s /home/danny/github-danny/server/docs/postcraft/content-raw server
```

3. add symlink as project in #:hyperdata-desktop

4. add `server` as project in VSCode

Ok, now I can make some placeholder docs there.

- `server/articles/deploy/build-site-transmission.md`
- `server/entries/server-setup_2024-10-19.md`
- `server/journal/2024-10-19.md`
- `server/todo/next-steps.md`
