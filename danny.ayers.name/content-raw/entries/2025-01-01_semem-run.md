Response: The semantic web has seen significant progress over recent years, driven by advancements in technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning. The current state of the semantic web is largely characterized by the development of standards and protocols that support the creation, exchange, and application of semantic data.

Some key areas of focus within the Semantic Web include:

1. **Semantically enriched information models**: The Semantic Web has evolved to incorporate rich and structured data formats such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data). These formats allow for more precise descriptions of resources in a web context, which can be crucial for semantic applications.

2. **Semantic integration services**: Tools like OWLonto are emerging to help developers automatically convert their ontologies into the OWL format, which is widely supported by Semantic Web technologies.

3. **Semantics-Driven Applications**: The Semantic Web has fostered the development of vast ecosystems of Semantic Web-based applications that can interact with each other and with external resources in a semantic way.

4. **Semantically Enhanced Data Access**: Technologies like SPARQL (SQL for Data) are increasingly being adopted to make data from RDF, JSON-LD, etc. easily accessible through standard SQL-like queries.

5. **Semantic Web Standards**: The development of standards such as Apache Jena and Neo4j continue to evolve the Semantic Web landscape by providing tools that support semantic data management, query processing, and other key tasks in the web.

6. **Semantic Web Applications**: There has been a significant increase in the number of commercial applications built using various Semantic Web technologies.

In summary, while there are still challenges and limitations within the Semantic Web landscape, it is now more widely adopted and utilized than ever before. Its potential for transforming how information is managed, shared, and used is becoming increasingly evident.

This query gives one result, containing the prompt & response from the above :
```sparql
PREFIX mcp: <http://purl.org/stuff/mcp/>
SELECT ?graph ?id ?prompt ?output ?timestamp
WHERE {
  GRAPH ?graph {
  ?s a mcp:Interaction ;
     mcp:id ?id ;
     mcp:prompt ?prompt ;
     mcp:output ?output ;
     mcp:timestamp ?timestamp .
    FILTER regex(str(?prompt), "Semantic")
}
}
```

This gives 2 results :
```sparql
SELECT *
WHERE {
  GRAPH ?graph {
  ?s ?p ?o
    FILTER regex(str(?o), "Semantic")
}
}
```

One is the triple with the prompt, the other the triple with the LLM output.
