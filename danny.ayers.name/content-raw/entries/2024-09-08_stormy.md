# Stormy Weather

I did start looking at server XMPP config again but a thunderstorm means the network is up & down.

Back to #Transmissions `ConfigMap`.

Hmm. Need docs to make sense of these.

Slight diversion : I'm adding code into `DirWalker` to ignore markdown files with a name start with `_` underscore. Hardcoded for now (like accepting `.md`).
