# Postcraft

#:postcraft is an application of #:transmissions which I put while figuring out #:transmissions. It's a static site builder, you're looking at its product. Right now it's **a crufty, fragile, seriously over-engineered and breathtakingly inefficient static site builder**. But that's not a problem. Things *should* be coupled loosely enough that I can incrementally improve all this with minimal breakage along the way. *Should* be.

The fact that I've messed up the CSS somewhere but have no idea where suggests there *is* a problem.

I'm only using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS for presentation, but it's all a bit of a lump right now. I need to tease out the bits that are actually in use, relocate and organise them in a way that I can work on them in isolation.

I'd better remind myself of the #:postcraft #:transmission and the manifest I'm using for `danny.ayers.name`.

**Ew.** The current filesystem setup really is a shambles.
