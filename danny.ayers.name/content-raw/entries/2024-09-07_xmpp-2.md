# Setting up XMPP pt.2

Yesterday I got to this:

```bash
nano /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml
ejabberdctl reload_config
ejabberdctl request-certificate all
```

When I hit ACME rate limiting. I just tried again:

```bash
root@hyperdata:~# ejabberdctl request-certificate all
Error: error
Error: "Challenge failed for domain conference.hyperdata.it: ACME server reported: 178.79.189.240: Invalid response from http://conference.hyperdata.it/.well-known/acme-challenge/XqMA-5eKaFy4hEmuP8jO7TUOzp_wmlvbR4DpuRpMqFY: 404 (error type: unauthorized)"
```

At [ejabberd setting up ACME](https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/configuration/basic/#setting-up-acme):

```yaml
listen:
  - module: ejabberd_http
    port: 5280
    tls: false
    request_handlers:
      /.well-known/acme-challenge: ejabberd_acme
```

Hah!

I just went to see what was happening on the server with:

```bash
lynx http://localhost:5280
```

And it gave me a sensible response. Then tried with `http://localhost:5280/admin` and it was asking for a login.

Ok, so, how about in a desktop browser with `https://xmpp.hyperdata.it/admin/`

Yes! It let me log in as admin.

But,

> Apparently your account has no administration rights in this server. Please check how to grant admin rights in: https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/installation/#administration-account

Docs better at https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/install/next-steps/#administration-account

Added:

```bash
acl:
  admin:
     user: admin@hyperdata.it
```

and the web interface is showing me stuff.

The Dino XMPP client running on desktop isn't connecting. Checking my old notes... I mentioned [mcabber](https://mcabber.com/) client, but nothing more.

Downloaded Android monocle client to phone (from F-Droid)

```bash
ejabberdctl live
...
ERROR: The ejabberd node 'ejabberd@localhost' is already running.


ps -aux | grep -i 'ejabberd'

kill 1234
```

I changed the static fs location in nginx conf to proxy instead. Got another rate limit. Grr.

It was trying to set up certs on `hyperdata.it`.

```bash
hosts:
  - localhost
#  - hyperdata.it
  - xmpp.hyperdata.it
  ejabberdctl reload_config
```
