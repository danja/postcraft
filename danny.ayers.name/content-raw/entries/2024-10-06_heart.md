Sunday, writing/social media day. Must do *some*, but such a backlog of other stuff distracting me...

#:farelo form-a-matic is crucial, I'll do a bit of coding there.

Visualization just crossed my mind, a little plan prep/org of notes needed. Find some old stuff.

Created a new repo along the way : https://github.com/danja/open-world-interface.git

#:todo make a wiki engine built on #:transmissions that works against #:postcraft and syncs with #:diamonds #:foowiki

SVG Wiki Whiteboard - used SVG.

Found this XML.com article I wrote in

```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/hyperdata-static$ grep -r whiteboard
xmlns/ibis/w6/xow/testing/.svn/text-base/xow.js.svn-base:   http://dannyayers.com/2003/08/jspwiki/whiteboard.htm
xmlns/ibis/w6/xow/testing/xow.js:   http://dannyayers.com/2003/08/jspwiki/whiteboard.htm
```
Hmm. Yes, that's old!

Hah, I couldn't remember it's name **[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net)**. Ok, I still have a login *dannyayers*. 'Joined 2000-12-23 16:33:37'.
Wonder what's there...  

Two projects I'd completely forgotten about :

[JemBlog](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jemblog/)
> This Sourceforge project was initially set up to publish JemBlog (RDF-backed server-side blogging). It's drifted: there is the Stiki Wiki which is RDF-backed, and there will also be some RDF API material ("Sambuca") following in the near future.

It drifted a lot. This direction.

[KnoBot](https://sourceforge.net/projects/knobot/)
> WYMIWYG KnoBot is a content management system for the semantic web designed to promote the exchange of content with a P2P and reputation based system. The aim is to create a socio-topical space, a perspective dependent space of information and knowledge.

I believe that was @retobg's project. Last activity on SourceForge, `.jar` releases, 10 years ago.

TurtleEditor  - used canvas

I made another new repo : [store-wrapper](https://github.com/danja/store-wrapper.git)

I had a GitHub notification related to this :

> [Gist](https://github.com/semanticarts/gist) is Semantic Arts' minimalist upper ontology for the enterprise. It is designed to have the maximum coverage of typical business ontology concepts with the fewest number of primitives and the least amount of ambiguity.

Linked from there, omg, this : https://semantechs.co.uk/turtle-editor-viewer/

Also - https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco - rather a capable ont doc toolset. I have uses for that...

https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/doc/gallery/

Sweet!

Nice touch - including markdown in `rdfs:comment`, having it render in the ont doc. Guess who's going to steal that idea...

Notification re. https://solidproject.org - all that's already on my todo list somewhere.
