# Groundhogs Again

*Yesterday I used the 'Today Again', this morning Groundhog Day was mentioned on the radio. So it goes. Again.*

Please create the mock module `src/api/common/MockApplicationManager.js`
This should expose the same method interfaces as `src/core/ApplicationManager.js`, do simple validation of call values and respond with dummy data as appropriate, logging calls to it and errors to the console using `src/utils/Logger.js`.
```
