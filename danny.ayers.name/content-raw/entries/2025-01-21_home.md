# Home

*I had fun on phone before I got up, trying to sort out termux/ubuntu home dirs. Now on the radio, a prog about working from home. Which I am doing right now.*

I started a note on LLM problems (on Markor) on phone. I wondered why I couldn't find it when I got to desk (auto-sync'd via Syncthing). Ops. I'd called it `2023-01-21_llm-problems.md`
