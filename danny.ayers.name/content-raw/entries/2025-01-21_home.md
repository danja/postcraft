I can run code using the "analysis tool" (also called REPL) which is a JavaScript environment.
The analysis tool is useful for:

Testing code before recommending it
Analyzing data structures
Complex calculations
Verifying assumptions about code behavior

I started a note on LLM problems (on Markor) on phone. I wondered why I couldn't find it when I got to desk (auto-sync'd via Syncthing). Ops. I'd called it `2023-01-21_llm-problems.md`
