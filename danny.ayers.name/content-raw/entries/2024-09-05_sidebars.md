# Postcraft Sidebars

I've got a #Postcraft instance for [FOAF-Retro](https://foaf-retro.hyperdata.it/) ok now.

It needs populating. Placeholders for content will be useful.

Sidebars. Mostly links.

These could be :

1. hardcoded in the (nunjucks) templates
2. specified in `manifest.ttl`
3. specified in markdown files

First pass, a combination of 2. and 3.

While I'm looking at this, it makes sense to also consider :

TODO to ignore files who's name begins with an underscore. That seems the easiest way of managing drafts.

TODO some way of making a list of (most) posts in a dir.

Ew. `src/services/rdf/ConfigMap.js` is _very_ specific. Hardcoded.

TODO little change in `manifest.ttl`

```
  fs:targetDirectory "cache/entries" ;
```
