# xkill

*I was trying to get Ubuntu "Software and Updates" to clean up my `sources.list`s. It made a modal error dialog that went off the bottom of the screen. I couldn't find it with `ps -A`. Stuck. Found this handy util for force-killing windows, new to me (though was already installed), exactly what I just needed - click on bad window - gone.*
