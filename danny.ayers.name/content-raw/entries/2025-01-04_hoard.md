# Hoard

*hyperdata-whiteboard*

I got distracted yesterday while sorting out the #:packer #:transmission (for concat'ing repos for LLMs), then in the evening, when I got back to desk I was too tired to do anything, gave up. Returning to it now, I need a small repo to run it against. As it happens, this morning in bed, a passing thought led me to start another[^1] little whiteboard project (with Claude). I'll make that a new repo.

Online, I've created https://github.com/danja/hoard

Locally:
```sh
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages
git submodule add https://github.com/danja/hoard.git hoard
cd hoard
npm init -y
```

Ok, so now I can try :
```sh
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
./trans packer ../hyperdata/packages/hoard
```

Ok, it fails as expected...

My head's a little fuzzy and Claudio's pestering. Dogwalk time.

[^1]: I've been around whiteboards a few times before, first time of note being a [SVG Wiki Whiteboard](https://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/11/19/svgwiki.html) in 2003.
