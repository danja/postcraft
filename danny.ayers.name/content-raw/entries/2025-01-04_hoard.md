I got distracted yesterday while sorting out the #:packer #:transmission (for concat'ing repos for LLMs), then in the evening, when I got back to desk I was too tired to do anything, gave up. Returning to it now, I need a small repo to run it against. As it happens, this morning in bed, a passing thought led me to start another[^1] little whiteboard project (with Claude). I'll make that a new repo.

Online, I've created https://github.com/danja/hoard

Locally:
```sh
cd ~/github-danny/hyperdata/packages
git submodule add https://github.com/danja/hoard.git hoard
cd hoard
npm init -y
```

Ok, so now I can try :
```sh
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
./trans packer ../hyperdata/packages/hoard
```

Ok, it fails as expected...

My head's a little fuzzy and Claudio's pestering. **Dogwalk** time.

Clearer head. I had another quick look at the repomix issue :

```sh
npm run rp

> transmissions@1.0.0 rp
> node --no-warnings $(which repomix) -c repomix.config-small.json . && node --no-warnings $(which repomix) -c repomix.config-large.json .

ðŸ“¦ Repomix v0.2.12

Error: Config file not found at repomix.config-small.json
...
```
**Fool Danny!**

My config files were called ` repopack.config-large.json` and  `repopack.config-small.json`.

Fixed. Great!! Now I can use repomix to make my alternative to repomix...

Still not quite there, but :

Break time.
