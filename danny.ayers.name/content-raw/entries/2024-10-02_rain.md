# Rainsday

It's pouring with rain, but I'm hoping to be going out later. When Mari messages to say my meds prescription is ready to pick up, we'll go ut for that, do a bit of shopping and have a coffee. There's also a little panelling job for me to do at hers, when convenient.  

Before I got up I did a bit of exploration around formulas for determining task priorities, with much help from Claude AI on the phone. Got to v1 bits for #Farelo.

## TODO

I must remember to use the ongoing `danny.ayers.name/todo/2024-10.md`, together with sub-project `todo/next-steps.md`.

Also markdown:

```text
- [ ] todo item 1
- [ ] todo item 2
```

I don't yet have a handler for that syntax,

Chat on LinkedIn has pushed a few things up my priority list.

- [ ] General sites' material presentation (ie. next little bits of #Postcraft)
- [ ] Update my CV
- [ ] What's I've been doing docs
- [ ] Document my current AI process/tips/tools
- [ ] update system prompts

New :

- [ ] #Transmissions/#KIA agent use case (Claudio B. mentioned) : genai chatbot backed by a software manual  

I'll get Claude to help me with my CV. Create a Project "PR" and add some of my small publication PDFs as `Project knowledge`.

Before anything else (but after making a coffee), I'll have an hour or so on #Farelo `form-a-matic`. That feels close to a working v1, soon should be very helpful for my productivity and also feeds a couple of nearby birds[^1].

[1^]:  "pali wan, kama pini tu."

I just checked back on this :

https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1fgj8ae/kill_two_birds_with_one_stone/

There was a new suggestion. So I asked Claude :

> What is the toki pona "pali wan, kama pini tu." in English?

<blockquote>
 The Toki Pona phrase "pali wan, kama pini tu." can be translated to English as:
 "Do one task, finish two."
 This phrase uses the following Toki Pona words:

 pali: work, do, make
 wan: one
 kama: to become, to arrive, to bring about
 pini: end, finish, complete
 tu: two

 The meaning conveys the idea of efficiency or accomplishing more than expected - by doing one task, you end up completing two things. It's similar to the English saying "killing two birds with one stone."
