# Eat Me

I'm sorting out docs, one thing I remembered I don't have in place yet is a syndication feed for these things. An absolute **didn't I do that aready?**.

Like, **I have history** in this space. I caught the tail end of the [RSS wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_web_syndication_technology). Such a daft (multi-fronted) war. Initially I was religiously RSS 1.0, the RDF. But despite my dogmatism, I was already aware at the time how awful RDF/XML was as a format in practice. It was an easy one to get sucked into, I was enchanted by the RDF model (still am, a sweetspot IMO, but it did need Turtle syntax and named graphs to properly make it viable for a regular dev). Good folks I knew were on **that side** and [Dave Winer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer) could be such a massively annoying arse. Really really massively.

In retrospect, respect where it's due, Winer did push things forward. Ok, a lot of that was in folks thinking about how to do this thing right, to counter his approach, which had an overabundance of ego at it's heart. That was a bit annoying itself, an intelligent, creative guy, you know I could begrudgingly call him  **visionary**. Except it was overshadowed by narcissism and belligerence.

Heh, I nearly put "IMHO" there. But that reminds me of an interchange I had with him where he was incredibly dismissive of my points, passive-aggressively using Valley acronyms. I responded with "UYB". I had made it up on the spur. But apparently it had made it into the urban dics, I lost the high ground.

But with the naming of **RSS 2.0** he showed some serious genious. Marketing-wise, awesome.     

Anyway, back to **my** ego. I've contributed content to 10 printed books. The only one I was the lead author on was [Beginning RSS and Atom Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Atom-Programming-Danny-Ayers/dp/0764579169). Heh, combined rating of 1.6 on reviews there.
It was probably pretty good. Not through my efforts directly, but Wrox Press at the time had a legion of expert/expert-ish reviewers that forced you to revise, think, revise. Also Andrew was very good at his stuff. I can't check, I gave all the copies I had away... oh wait, I might have the Turkish translation...(*mouldy shelves...*)
Nope. That is [Web 2.0 Teknolojileri](https://www.amazon.com/Web-2-0-Teknolojileri-Eric-Vlist/dp/975297855X/). Wtf did I do for that? Was the same period as the RSS. Probably something with that, shoehorning in RDF somehow.

Oh yeah. Gorblimey, quite a lot of this looks like my stuff. **FOAF!**

Over the decade or so I was doing the freelance writing stuff, I did learn how to play the publishers somewhat. **Engage the reviewer, not the reader**.  

Code examples in Python ffs. So I must have learnt a little bit of it at some point before forgetting it again. Also XSLT involved (on RDF/XML, eek!). But XSLT was a good language, despite the horror syntax. [Jeni Tennison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeni_Tennison) frequently sent me dizzy with the elegance she pulled out of the hat.  

It is surprising what still lives. I recently rediscovered this [Pet Profiles](https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/pets/) thing I did in, er...2004. Most of the associated code around there is now totally broken. But [Sambuca's Profile](https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/pets/2004-04-24/sambuca-css.xml), using CSS on RDF/XML, sweet. Has exactly the same little layout probs I didn't get around to fixing 20 years ago.   

## I've not quite finished with my ego

So in this fog of RSS war, some righteous folks came up with a cunning plan: [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)).

I get an ack on [RFC4287](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287).

**OK, ego spent.**

I was all-in with Atom Format, but kind-of backstepped out of the [Protocol, RFC5023](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5023). I'd love to say it was because I saw the redundancy of that on top of **Fielding-compliant REST**, but really it was because the other folks were shitloads better at protocols, I was out of my depth, had nothing to offer. *In retrospect*, good move. Now I see the redundancy. And the Web stage has shifted to make absolutely awful practices that have issues dating back to [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP). I'm sure, hope and pray (in an atheistic manner)  [timbl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) has many years left on this mortal coil, because he has a hella lotta grave-spinning backed up.

Yeah, in retrospect, Atom was the right idea. The folks around microformats, (hat tip [Tantek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantek_%C3%87elik)) had a valid point that HTML could easily carry the same information just as easily, no need for a different content format. But pragmatically, one sliver of a little toenail towards the Winer, it does now make sense to use a different format. I can still get on a high horse about content negotiation being there if you want it, **so merrr!**

Anyway, however long ago I got to desk this session, I had feed on mind. This is a nice little exercise. With my current workflow & tooling, **how long will it take me to add a feed** to this site?

On my own I would guess maybe 2 very stumbly hours. I have to remember how to use the templater I've got here, I've not looked at for a few months ([nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) - it looked best at the time) and also some of my own code from a day ago... (#:adhd is a thing).

But I don't want to waste my own scant cognitive resources on something like this. Claude understands my setup, I made it so for his kind.
