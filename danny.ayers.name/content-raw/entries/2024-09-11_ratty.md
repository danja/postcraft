Grr, task paralysis through overwhelmedness is getting me again today.

A GTD thought : when I'm stuck on what to work on, choose something that'll help productivity

## TODO

- form-a-matic
- update `hkms-desktop` : new clone of [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar), move my customizations across

## form-a-matic

Continuing from yesterday.

Collecting background for a Claude project. Put stuff around (desktop) :

```
/home/danny/github-danny/trans-apps/docs/references/rdf-ext
```

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-other/rdf-ext/grapoi$
...
repopack --verbose -c /home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/repopack.config.json
```

add repopacks from all the libs in `package.json`

After _hours_ with Claude I now have a not-quite-right `form-a-matic.js` and a very broken `test-fam.js`

But I think there's enough in place that I can now get those working without Claude.

Clearing a few tabs. I've done 'Save All" into a folder, but some should go somewhere near here. A bit annoying, this is what [Strandz](https://strandz.it) should be doing for me.
