# Whelms

*The things that pile up, and if you're not too careful, can overwhelm you (whelm is a genuine word, albeit considered archaic)*

right after each DirWalker, the file data should be pushed to SPARQL store



* SPARQL processors in #:transmissions
* #:transmissions application to walk dirs, consume docs from fs & determine meta, push to SPARQL

At desk today, I've got several subprojects vying for my attention. There's a lot of overlap, and not a little recursion at a conceptual level. I want to capture the methodology of building these things as an ontology.  

An overarching factor is that with LLMs in the mix, **previous best practices** (on some measure of bestness) **aren't necessarily the best approaches any more**. eg. [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it), *"You ain't gonna need it"* legitimately assumes there is a cost to making something, "always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them" makes sense. But when the cost becomes negligible, as is increasingly the case for activities that are in scope for LLMs.
