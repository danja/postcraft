# Woof

*There are hunters with dogs nearby, Claudio's really agitated.*

 Before getting out of bed, in my waking-up research session I got annoyed (again) at my notetaking setup. On the phone I currently use [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) markdown editor, which is autosync'ed with my desktop using [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/). I have dev in progress on #:squirt for improving this, but the frustration did give me an idea: in-browser editor, two-pane, using #:semtags as hyperlinks that when double-clicked in one pane, they open the corresponding URL in the other pane. Worth a #:spike! So I did a little dev with Claude (while still in bed). Got some starter code, and with my initial prompt and Claude's handover doc there should be enough to take it forward as and when. Even if the idea is a good one, the implementation won't be properly useful until I have a bit more infrastructure - #:tbox, specifically #:semem - in place. So I've dumped all the in the #:squirt part of the #:farelo repo for now. Now at desk, onto that infrastructure.
