Download to my server first? But how, given whatever auth Google is using..? Wireshark to read actual messages?

Claude suggested download to Google Drive first, then other more interesting suggestions, including using Selenium or Puppeteer. I think I played with Selenium a while back, the mock-browser setup would be useful elsewhere for me. To consider.

Asked Grok:

I need to download my email archives from gmail but I have a very unreliable internet connection. For downloading from simple URLs I would use wget -c and resume if the line dropped. When I try downloading the gmail archive from a browser is does have a kind of resume, but doesn't appear to restart where it left off a lot of the time. It also has quite a complicated URL and it looks like there is some kind of auth involved too. How can I do a reliable, resumable, efficient download?

I understand your concern. Downloading a large email archive from Gmail can be challenging, especially with an unreliable internet connection. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you download your Gmail archives reliably, resumably, and efficiently:

Method 1: Using wget with Gmail's API

Gmail provides an API that allows you to download your email archives programmatically. You'll need to:

Enable the Gmail API for your account:
Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
Navigate to APIs & Services > Library and search for "Gmail API".
Click on the result, then click on the "Enable" button.
Create credentials for your project (OAuth client ID).
Install the curl and jq command-line tools:
curl is used to send HTTP requests, and jq is used to parse JSON responses.
Use the following command to download your email archives:
curl -X GET \
 https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?labelIds=INBOX&maxResults=1000 \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -o messages.json
Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with the access token obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

This command downloads the first 1000 messages in your inbox. You can adjust the maxResults parameter to change the batch size.

To resume the download, you can use the --continue option with curl:

curl -X GET \
 https://www.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?labelIds=INBOX&maxResults=1000&startMessageId=MESSAGE_ID \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -o messages.json \
 --continue
Replace MESSAGE_ID with the ID of the last message downloaded.

Method 2: Using wget with Gmail's IMAP

Gmail provides an IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) interface that allows you to access your email archives. You'll need to:

Enable IMAP access for your Gmail account:
Go to your Gmail settings (gear icon) > Forwarding and POP/IMAP > Enable IMAP.
Install the wget command-line tool.
Use the following command to download your email archives:
wget -r -l 1 -A imap -P /path/to/download/folder imap://imap.gmail.com
This command downloads all emails from your inbox, using the IMAP protocol. The -r option tells wget to follow links, -l 1 sets the maximum recursion depth to 1, -A imap specifies the file name pattern, and -P sets the download directory.

To resume the download, you can use the --continue option with wget:

wget -r -l 1 -A imap -P /path/to/download/folder --continue imap://imap.gmail.com
Tips and Variations

To download specific labels or folders, modify the labelIds or folder parameter in the API request or IMAP URL.
To download attachments, use the --recursive option with wget and specify the attachment file name pattern.
To download emails in a specific format (e.g., MBOX, EML), use a tool like imap-sync or mbox2eml.
If you encounter issues with authentication or connection timeouts, try using a VPN or a more reliable internet connection.
Remember to respect Gmail's terms of service and usage limits when downloading your email archives.
