# Stream

I'll push this out now, pre-pre-draft. Note blog title (#:todo italicize - "Raw*er*"). Taking me ages to get things down, break for more immediate dopamine-shot generating activities for a while... 

*On the BBC Radio 4 news this morning it mentioned that UK water bills were going to be significantly increased. This is despite the recipient companies having displayed an egregious lack of concern over water supplies to consumers and appalling disregard for the environment. The following stream of consciousness is lumpy like British rivers.*

There's a lot I need to write up. There's also a lot of **stuff** I need to do. The two are deeply [intertwingled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity). The latter is much better at holding my attention, the former I can keep in my head until I get around to it. But I just had a trip to the UK, family-related, that totally disrupted my mental waterways. Time for an **unstructured dump**.

In chat this morning with #:ClaudioB, he mentioned the [Model Context Protocol](http://modelcontextprotocol.io/). I'd just started looking at this before I got called away, but not before ~~I'd~~ we'd (#:ClaudeAI & I) done a first pass at an [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) mapping : [Model Context Protocol Ontology](https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/mcp/). This is very relevant to something I've been working on, #:LingueFranche, see below.

## KIA Intelligence Agency

**A heterogenous community of autonomous agents.**

This isn't really a thing yet. But it's where I'm heading with *all the other things* (jeez, there is a lot I need to write up).

For convenience, near future, a testbed/playground using [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/)-based [MUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_computer-mediated_communication). I did have ejabberd running on my server before, but I'm now in the process of setting up [Prosody](https://prosody.im/) in a Docker container, in which other stuff will live. Docker for repeatability, Prosody because it has a bit less baggage.




### Semantic Hashtags

I should explain the #:SemanticHashtag syntax, which also relates to #:LingueFranche. I can't remember whether or not I got as far as spec'ing this out yet, but it's an easy one in principle. Just a small extension of the familiar [folksonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy) **#hashtag**. Rather that it having global scope (as on Twitter etc), it's localised.

> A context (in this case the domain https://hyperdata.it) *MAY* assert it's in use (eg. via a HTML `meta` tag). In which case further disambiguation *SHOULD* be made available in that context. This *MAY* be expressed using a dereferenceable IRI, linked from the #:tag.

In practice, I'm including them in the [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) I write. At some point I'll put a #:processor in the rendering pipeline to link them to *something useful*. At minimum, a list of the pages here in which the term is used. It's something that can be **progressively enhanced**.

## My Infrastructure

#:ClaudioB also asked earlier about what I do for hosting. Currently I use s/[linode](https://www.linode.com)/Akamai. I have maybe their cheapest Linux virtual host (physically in London Docklands somewhere), 2GB RAM, some kind of minimal CPU cover. From here it looks like bare metal, I run Ubuntu on that. On top, main thing is [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) for static Web, proxying to other local services as appropriate. [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for certs. I do most things via ssh in a terminal. The bandwidth is great, performance adequate for much (`cough`) *regular* stuff. When I started using them a few years back they were about the cheapest that seemed to get good reviews for such a setup.

On home LAN I've got a couple of desktops and a laptop, a couple of oddities I'm in the process of resurrecting and an Android phone (with [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/), which is awesome). Oh yeah, and my mother's (very) old iPhone, which I've yet to play with. First one I've owned (I did have a little Apple laptop for a while, years ago, but $s and familiarity mean I'm all-Ubuntu now). Oh yeah, I've also a handful of [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) microcontroller-based things I've made that are WiFi/HTTP-aware, when switched on and behaving themselves.

My AI budget is limited, pay-fors at the moment are [Claude](https://claude.ai) Pro and the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co)

## Documentation

[11:49, 19/12/2024] Claudio Baldassarre: btw how did you produce the documentation?
[11:49, 19/12/2024] Claudio Baldassarre: and who do you have the web hosting with?
