# Tibicos

Oriana's due back from Switzerland today, I've been looking after her water kefir, aka [tibicos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibicos) (fascinating stuff). I need to prep a few other things for her return, but first an hour on #form-a-matic.

I need to set up publishing of Farelo's Postcraft asap for docs on form-a-matic, but that should be straightforward. Form-a-matic will need a little thought, at 13:11 on a rainy day my head is up for that.

* publish hyperdata subprojects
