# Wall-Y

This evening there's the inauguration open day of [Apuano Appeso ASD arrampicata indoor](https://www.facebook.com/apuanoappeso) climbing wall, 1/2 hour drive (thanks Mari!) down the valley in Gallicano. Run by the same (welcoming, helpful) folks that had one very nearby in Pieve Fosciano which I went to a few times last year.
