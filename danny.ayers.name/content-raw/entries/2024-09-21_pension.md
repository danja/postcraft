# Pension

Title is a note to self. I need to fill in some forms for Derbyshire County Council so I can get pension from the period I worked for High Peak College (network admin/support).

Bits of admin on this desktop before anything else.

Fool Danny, I'd forgotten I'd started `danny.ayers.name/todo/2024-09.md` etc for my ongoing todo list.

for building `hyperdata-desktop` :
