*because I am*

I've been through many phases with #:transmissions, with varying levels of progress. Most recently, wasting a lot of time because of bad organization in the core. And lack of tests.

So I reckon I need a big refactor, something like : `transmissions/todo/refactoring-plan_2024-11-03.md`

But I need to be clear. Describe things first.

First (not!) pass: `transmissions/articles/transmission-model/architecture.md`

Online again!!

Remember #:elfquake civic + danny emergency planning. Any vocabs in use already?
