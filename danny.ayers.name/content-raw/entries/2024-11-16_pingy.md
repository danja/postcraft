# Pingy-ping

*While tidying up the other day I found an old phone. I wasn't sure whether or not to throw it, so put it on to charge. Broken screen. Now it keeps going pingy-ping.*

1. #:todo `/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/todo/next-steps.md`
2. #:todo Verbo photo
3. #:todo carving prep
4. #:todo 1-page docs (Transmissions urgent)

AGAIN

But I have got past the annoying restructure problem with Transmissions, so can move on.
