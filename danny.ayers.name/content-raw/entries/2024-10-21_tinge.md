# Tinge

'Tinge' was the solution to the clue 'Hint' in today's Guardian Quick Crossword, the one I got a little stuck on - shoddy clue, imho.

I completed it in 8 minutes - a personal best, I believe. I think I got it down to 10 when I was doing it pretty much every day in Buxton, in the pub after work. Now I only try every few week.

This was after getting Wordle in 3 really quickly.

I have slight mania. Known, controlled, environmental cause. I was up all night coding, only got an hour or so's sleep before the alarm went off (at 9:57). I actually felt reasonably rested, soon got on with things. I have drifted off on tangents 3 or 4 times, but no worries, flights of fancies are fine, I was very aware being a bit fugueish.

Drifting a bit now.

So. Couple of hour's job: get all my #:postcraft instances processed and bunged where they should be. Locally first, but it'll be the same structure on the server.

I'm struggling to focus on this - the #:tbox container thing is calling me. After spending a lot of time getting #:t to load (ES) modules from arbitrary location, I really want to stick all this code in a SPARQL store. The assumption that source code should exist in files on a filesystem is very deeply wired into anyone born after maybe 1940. It's only a bloody persistence mechanism. I want my code up there in the Giant Global Graph.

Loads of security hazards, mostly because it's not the usual way of doing things, fs stuff has been pentested to buggery.

Where was I?

## Postcraft Instances Go Go!

I reckon I need a root `manifest.ttl` (in `server/deploy`) that has a list of includes to pick up and run the individual instances.

Where's that ns?

Oh dear. I was thinking separation of concerns but this is something like the bastard child of premature disoptimisation and NAGNI.

```turtle
@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .
@prefix fs: <http://purl.org/stuff/filesystem/> .
@prefix pc: <http://purl.org/stuff/postcraft/> .
@prefix t: <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> . # for custom terms & instances
```

From now on, stick everything under :

```turtle
@prefix tns: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmissions/> .
```

Flip that lot ^ later.

What does this root manifest need to say?

> A set of relative URLs that contain the `manifest.ttl`s of each of the #:postcraft instances.

#:todo I should get #:vb VocBench running soon.

#:todo Grr. Need to modify all the Turtle.

Ok, I've got things like :

```turtle
@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .

:clean a trm:Pipeline ;
    rdfs:label "clean" ;
    rdfs:comment "directory cleaner" ;
    trm:pipe (:r10 :r20 :r30 :r40 :r50 :r60) .
```

Each of those `transmissions.ttl` can hold multiple transmissions.


Ops. It's the `manifest.ttl` I'm meant to be looking at.

Simplest thing that could possibly work?

JSON guff.

Hmm. I want those files to be treated as named graphs, but also try and avoid flipping to nquads just yet if I can help it.

REview -

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
 ./trans postcraft ../server/docs/postcraft
 ```

 So I guess the child manifests should have an association with the application that uses them.

 I can't be bothered diving into local fs vs. global URLs right now, just give them a path.

 The manifests as they stand are instancy, many share the same **application**, just different details.

 How have I been doing fs paths in them so far!?

Crudely.

```turtle
t:CSS a pc:StaticGroup ;
    pc:site <https://danny.ayers.name> ;
    fs:sourceDirectory "layouts/mediocre/css" ;
    fs:targetDirectory "public/home/css" .
```

I think this is when SKOS is called for. But for now, simplest thing....

Naming. Saigon, shit.

`realm` would probably be more accurate, but that's so overloaded. Go with `space`

Prefix `tran` looks ok.

```turtle
# server/deploy/manifest.ttl

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix : <http://purl.org/stuff/transmissions/> .

<http://danny.ayers.name/space> a :Space ;
  rdfs:label "danny.ayers.name"
      :app :postcraft;
      :defPath "../postcraft/danny.ayers.name"; # definition path?
      :targetPath "../server/2024/danny-ayers.name" .
```

Ok, that might be enough of a starter. But better try it first with the new spaces-

```turtle
# server/deploy/manifest.ttl

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix dct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix : <http://purl.org/stuff/transmissions/> .

<http://hyperdata.it/server/space> a :Space ;
  rdfs:label "server"
      :app :postcraft;
      :defPath "../server/docs/postcraft"; # definition path
      :targetPath "../server/2024/server" .

<http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/space> a :Space ;
  rdfs:label "transmissions"
      :app :postcraft;
      :defPath "../transmission/docs/postcraft"; # definition path
      :targetPath "../server/2024/transmissions" .
```


Heh, I'd got a note-to-self in there mentioning SIOC. I bet that has some of these things.

So the runner will be something like :

```sh
cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
./trans ../server/deploy
```

Ok,that works. But how do I get at the Dataset?

```sh
| Running :  (SM) p10 a DatasetReader
DatasetReader, datasetName = dataset
DatasetReader, message[datasetName] =
```

Enough on that.

Next job was to check how far I'd got with #:fam

Wait, do the repopacks in case I feel inspired in bed on the phone in the morning
