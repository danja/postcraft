# Scaffold

*I need to do a little Docker tidying. It relates to my #:tbox scaffolding. Also I've a feeling The Scaffold, who sang "[Lily the Pink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x8D4T--0v4)" had some connection with the Liverpool dockers.

Bunch of stuff running that I'd forgotten about. My (very weedy) remote server was falling over thanks to TrustGraph. This desktop machine can run it fine, though doesn't need to right now.


```sh
locate wekan
/home/danny/HKMS/wekan/docker-compose.yml
/space/hkms-apps-bits/hkms-apps-from-server/wekan
/space/hkms-apps-bits/hkms-apps-from-server/wekan/docker-compose.yml
...
docker compose -f /home/danny/HKMS/wekan/docker-compose.yml down -v
docker ps
```

Ok, that just leaves LibreChat, which I'd also forgotten about, but want to use.

I want to add my latest node bits along with Fuseki to the #:tbox container. Claude..!
