*I signed up to the American Association for the Advancement of Science so as to look at a paper. I've also introduced an annoying bug into my code, so I'll pronounce it "arse".*

Yeah, bug in #:transmissions such that #:postcraft (which builds this site) doesn't run correctly. My own fault. I pushed forward on #:packer which needed the `DirWalker` process. I delegated a lot to Claude, made changes I assumed were ok because the `test_dirwalker` application still ran without error. Fool Danny, it's not got enough coverage.

Two steps back needed.

I was curious about this :
* [Spontaneous Cortical Activity Reveals Hallmarks of an Optimal Internal Model of the Environment](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1195870)

The paper quickly drops into biological jargon, but this in the abstract furnished me with keywords I could follow up :

> Using a Bayesian model of sensory cortical processing, we related stimulus-evoked and spontaneous neural activities to inferences and prior expectations in an internal model and predicted that they should match if the model is statistically optimal. To test this prediction, we analyzed visual cortical activity of awake ferrets during development.

"Bayes", "priors", *"ferrets"*...

While around neuroscience I also stumbled on :
* [The Transmitter](https://www.thetransmitter.org/) - some interesting (not too biological) stuff
