# Desk

*I've cleaned my desk. The rest of the spring cleaning is still in-progress.*

Resurrecting HAL the C7 box. Downloading https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86/alpine-extended-3.20.3-x86.iso  I don't know how big that'll be. Ideally I want the OS to fit on the 1GB flash drive inside the box. Ok, set https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.20/releases/x86/alpine-standard-3.20.3-x86.iso as well, just in case. Dogwalk time.
