# Happy New Year!

Foggy brain yet again. Not for the first time on New Year's Day, but irritatingly I wasn't up all that late and didn't drink to excess. I did have fun last night, my first attempt at livestreaming. Around 7pm I was feeling blocked at desk (my head, not the code) and an idea formed in my head. I'd been listening to Drum & Bass. Didn't seem right, hmm, bagpipes? [Big Bad Bollocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjdnGNfDyd4)? Pogues? Hang on, is there any D&B in 3/4 or 6/8 time? I decided to make some. By midnight.    

Easiest camera to set up was my Android phone (after I spent half an hour sorting out a tripod). Perplexity suggested Facebook was the easiest platform, but neglected to tell me it has a very confusing UI with sod all settings accessible. Worst, whatever resolution/codec it uses, it's a network glutton. I'm not sure how much actually got streamed, 50% of the times I checked it was waiting to connect.
