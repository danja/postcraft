# Postcraft Cleaner

A quick job to start the day. I need a #transmission, as part of #Postcraft, that will wipe all rendered files - cache and `.html`.

Ideally to run as :

```
./trans postcraft clean /home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

The current runner is :

```
./run postcraft /home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
or
./run postcraft-beta /home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

This will involve addressing more than one transmission in `transmission.ttl`

TODO rename `transmission.ttl` to `transmissions.ttl`

TODO rename `trm:Pipeline` etc

Starting point, I need a key for the separate transmissions.`rdfs:label` will do.

```
:clean a trm:Pipeline ;
    rdfs:label "clean" ;
    rdfs:comment "directory cleaner" ;
    trm:pipe (:SC) .
```

Yuck, so many TODOs!

Jeez, that took me a very long time. I really need to write those `grapoi` docs.

**2024-08-30** continued

That was unpleasant, sorting out the command-line (`yargs`) handling. Settled on a reasonable neat solution for subtasks/named transmissions, a dot notation :

```
./trans postcraft-beta.clean ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

A quick test of this :

Grr. I suppose I'd better do some light tweaking before putting this into place.

- Group the markdown dirs. A `raw` dir suits me.
- Rename `cache`

I want to keep the dir structures in places, but pull the content from git so I'll put a flag in `FileRemove` to ignore `.dotfiles`.
In `.gitignore` maybe:

```
cache/*
!cache/.*
```

I also need to copy across static content.

```
danny.ayers.name/public/home
```

Phew! Ok, done all that.

TODO `services/DatasetReader` is very hard-coded.
