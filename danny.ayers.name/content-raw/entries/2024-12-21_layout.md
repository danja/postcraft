# Layout

With Claude's help (I gave the `index.html` + CSS files as attachments), I've fixed the immediate layout bug I had here. My system prompt (which I'll post in a mo) asks Claude for suggestions, and after this it suggested :
> q4: Should we implement a sticky header or navigation elements?

A sticky menu button was already in my todos, so I went `q4`. Claude gave me a bunch of code using React.  To which I responded:
> It must be vanilla JS, please revise

Now I have a sticky button! I'll populate it later, daylight activities to do.

When I tried it on my phone it still wasn't quite right, but clearing the cache sorted it out. So I've added this -

```html
<!-- #:todo remove when stable -->
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">
```

The stuff here is all lightweight, so that may stay a while.

All good!
