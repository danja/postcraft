# Hat

*because my hat is on the desk*

I'm in the process of setting up #:server infrastructure so all the #:postcraft instances (ie. rendering for my docs) can be run from a single command (using #:transmissions).

I've already got per-instance `manifest.ttl` files describing where things should go. I need an uber-manifest to run all of these. I'll need a few more vocab terms (and really need to refactor those). Coincidentally, the other day I stumbled on a vocab I did in 2001 :  

RDF Process Profile (RPP) Specification 0.0.1

Claude summarises :
> RDF Process Profile (RPP) is a lightweight XML-based specification from 2001 that describes processes using RDF (Resource Description Framework). It aims to standardize how data processors are described, moving away from data-centric approaches toward resource-centric ones. RPP allows both online and offline processes to be represented as web resources, with descriptions of all required resources needed to carry out data processing. The specification includes a vocabulary of classes (like Profile, Component, Algorithm) and properties (like location, availability, input/output) that can be used to describe processes. RPP is designed to be extensible and can serve as a foundation for more sophisticated layers of process description, potentially enabling automated process discovery and execution.


```sh
rapper -i rdfxml -o turtle rpp.rdfs > rpp.ttl
```

Ok, I've set up :

```sh
@prefix rpp: <http://purl.org/stuff/rpp/> .
```
