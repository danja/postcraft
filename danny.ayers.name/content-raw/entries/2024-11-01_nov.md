Continuing with #:server:deploy

Give it an hour.

## Deploy

Ok, remember I need to modify all `manifest.ttl`s

Oh dear, I need to do the rendering for each of:
```sh
.
├── articles
├── entries
├── journal
└── todo
```

for every instance. The `transmissions.ttl` for postcraft app is already really long.

Two-pronged attack :

1. modularise `transmissions.ttl`
2. render-on-save (the node watch thing)

I started the modularisation, I can't remember where I got up to. See if Claude remembers.

#:todo the node watch thing - record recent changes, pass to AI



---

#:todo I want #:transmissions to run as a daemon, in a container, hot-pluggable


#:todo #:t transmissions watchdog, record stuff from node watch, for #:farelo - what is getting attention?

#:todo #:farelo - remember llama fs
