# Iron

This morning I was woken first around 9:00 by Claudio wanting to get under my blanket. He's been doing it all week, seems to like to start the day with a snuggle. I'd just about dozed off again when the alarm on my phone went off, 9:57 (timed so I can have a pee & glass of water before BBC Radio 4 news). Dozing off again, Oriana phoned, asking if I had an iron & ironing board. I have iron which I never use, so I got up and took it across.

I remember last century, all the musicians in South London would use ironing boards as keyboard stands. I'm pretty sure I'll have one somewhere, probably under piles of junk in the cantina, take forever to find. But I do have a couple of spare keyboard stands...

## Today

Annoying I've somehow managed to break `hyperdata-desktop` (==`pulsar-edit`) while reorganising things. I'm now trying to rebuild, at some point I may have forgotten to do :

```sh
nvm use
```

and got lib versions muddled.

13:03 earlier-than-usual dogwalk, I need a bit of fresh air.

`npm install` mentions :

```sh
--cache=/home/danny/.npm
```

So just in case :

```sh
cd ~/.npm
sudo rm -r *
```
