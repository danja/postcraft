# Walking Hat

The bedroom was chilly last night so I wore a beany hat in bed. I was wearing it when I woke up. Finally found it on the bedside table on the other side of the bed. How it got there is a mystery. I didn't go over there, it's not the kind of trick Claudio plays. Which leaves the possibility of rodents...

So it's Saturday, #ELFQuake day. So I **must** do at least an hour on that.

The dependency tree for that includes a lot of tasks that help elsewhere, so

17:15 and I still haven't got to code...

Using bit from Markmap :

TODO `services/text/MarkdownToJSON.js`, `services/viz/JSONToSVGTree.js`

The latter using `markmap-lib` to have a look at the output shape, because I now reckon for simplicity & reuse, #form-a-matic should have an intermediate JS object representation (so RDF->JSON...JSON->HTML), initially a simple tree.

First, dump some [idea bits](#idea-bits).

Unidentified Reality Issues

TODO make #Transmissions Turing Complete

This is currently a YAGNI, but I reckon worth doing before release because it make _anything_ possible and implementation will need changes in the core engine of Transmissions.

Needs :

- Conditional branching
- Looping or recursion

For r/tokipona

The English idiom "to kill two birds with one stone" expresses a very useful concept (to achieve two things with a single action) in a horrible way. I was pleased to find that the Italian equivalent "prendere due piccioni con una fava" is less violent - to catch two pigeons with one bean. There are other variants around Europe [^1]. My geo is terrible, no idea which country has "roast two pieces meat on one fire", but again that's a bit less nasty.

I'd like a pleasant English version and to find that, getting it to work in the language of good seems a good approach. So how would you express this in toki pona?

For twitter:

First they came for the Venezualians, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Venezualian.
Then they came for the Haitians, and I did not speak out, because I was not a Haitian.
