My essential daytime beverage is **Caffé Americano, Macchiato, à la Turk**.

In the UK I used to drink the classic **Brit Instant**. One or two spoonfuls of powder from a jar, in a mug, good splash of milk, spoonful of sugar. Of necessity, usually the cheap stuff, but Nescafé by preference and/or in posh company.
I can't bear the silage run-off now.

Christ on an e-bike, so many distractions today. Oriana just called, due up from Siena in 10 mins, asked if I can give her a hand shifting stuff.

Golly, via Duolingo, a name I believe I recognise from the distant past, #:foaf [James Tauber](https://jtauber.com). I can't place him yet, my mental sorting office will take a while to locate the relevant pile.  I doubt I know him through his main field, he does lots of Ancient Greek as [J.K. Tauber](https://jktauber.com) -
> at the intersection of computing, linguistics, philology, and learning science

He has written up [My History with the Web](https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web/), which mentions the W3C, may be a hint for the backend posties.
This project of his I must #:todo revisit : https://modelling-music.com

#:todo come up with a short #:semtag that I'll remember for check it out/revisit.

Reminds me, I need to see if I got around to doing one of these : https://linktr.ee/jtauber

His *History* is on https://thoughtstreams.io, not sure I've seen that before. But **microblogging** is very strongly in scope for *my stuff*, #:todo check it out. Over there the page has :
> get stream as: [markdown](https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web.md) or [atom](https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web.atom)

The Atom feed follows the usual reverse-chrono sequence of posts (which is kinda irrelevant, they are datetime-stamped). #:todo remember bloody Atom, is important here.

The Markdown feed is forward-chrono (which makes sense here, the *History..* is a sequential, self-contained article). Just the usual #:md syntax, with `---` (ie. `<br>`) inserted as post separators.

Coincidentally I woke up this morning with a closely related thing on my mind, #:chunks or for here -

## Chunky Chunks

I need dynamically modifiable, identifiable blocks of text.

So many distractions today.
