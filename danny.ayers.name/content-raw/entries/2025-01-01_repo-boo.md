# Repo Boo

Very annoying. I've been using Claude projects **heavily** for recent dev. Made possible by [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) which essentially does an annotated concat of a repo's files. Tonight my thing decided to say:

```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/github-danny/transmissions$ npm run rp

> transmissions@1.0.0 rp
> repomix -c repomix.config-small.json . && repomix -c repomix.config-large.json .

(node:61405) ExperimentalWarning: Importing JSON modules is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)

ðŸ“¦ Repomix v0.2.12

Error: Config file not found at repomix.config-small.json
For more help, please visit: https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/issues
(node:61421) ExperimentalWarning: Importing JSON modules is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

I've no idea what I've done that would impact there. Can't remember if this is running a global or local install. Ok, first thing, clear caches and try again. "Hey Claude, how do I..?"
```sh
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

While that's running, there is something else I want to do nearby. Squat the npm registry with a couple of things. #:transmissions & #:semem at least, there might be a couple of others. None will be out-of-the-box usable as they should be (as I would interpret proper etiquette), but I think I'm at a point where I can legitimately grab those names. I've put loads of work in, am committed to making them useful for other parties.

It might even encourage me to get the GitHub CI/CD bits in place (for the badges, innit).

Golly :
```sh
npm warn using --force Recommended protections disabled.
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated sourcemap-codec@1.4.8: Please use @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec instead
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported

Aw, `npm install squirt` works (whatever that is), I'd have squatted that too. Ok, no biggy.
```sh
npm install squirty
npm error code E404
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.yarnpkg.com/squirty - Not found
```

For that I only need to do some minor renaming. #:transmissions would have been a proper pain. I did it once already - had the project working label "treadmill" initially, but decided something more accurately descriptive would be better. Horrible search & replace - not too bad with code, but docs got messy.
