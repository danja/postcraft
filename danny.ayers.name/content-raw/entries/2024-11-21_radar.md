# Radar

*__My First Radar__ arrived in the post this morning - more on that later...*

Currently trying to sort out #:transmissions module loading. Have done my usual tricks : not enough tests, trying to change too much at once. Now I've got to keep going until the thing isn't broken...

Other VSCode AI tools to note, found while looking for music to play - in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjOmi_4Ztj4

I tweaked `package.json` for this :
/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/transmissions/entries/2024-11-10_testes.md

Tweaked this to use clean pulsar for now :
sudo e /usr/share/applications/hyperdata.desktop
