# Semem Fix & Deploy

I made a todo list here yesterday without any explanation. Didn't publish. Invisible todo list is absolutely not what I want on my blog front page! My top priority this week is doc organisation, so I'll let myself off this time. I've changed the date on the file, this is it I'll now fill it out...

A little job for this morning is a little explore of [Semem](https://github.com/danja/semem).

It appears to (mostly) work, here's the [console log of a run](https://danny.ayers.name/entries/2025-01-01_semem-run.html).

But, **what is it doing?**

What I want right now, as a bit of scaffolding for what I want to explore, is a nodejs version of [memoripy](https://github.com/caspianmoon/memoripy) that uses a (remote) SPARQL store as (part of) its knowledgebase.

I only tried running it after many hours implementing it in a Claude project. Then had a couple of hours manually tweaking to get it to (mostly) run. It's definitely interacting with Ollama for embeddings & chat, a SPARQL endpoint for persistence. I don't see the extracted concepts in the SPARQL store.

Last night I had a short session with Claude, aiming to document what we had so far. I've put the artifacts over here : https://github.com/danja/semem/tree/main/docs/description_2025-01-01.md It sounds marvellous, but how much is true?

## Banebane

I had a chat with ClaudioB yesterday morning, pointed him to my notes so far on #:semem. He asked me if I had a **live instance** he could play with. A very good question! Not for the first time I'll quote -

### Connolly's Bane

> **"The bane of my existence is doing things that I know the
computer could do for me"**
\â€“ Dan Connolly

*Which reminded me I've not been in touch with [Graham Klyne](https://www.ninebynine.org/) for many years. A blog post of his drew my attention to that quote. Good-o, he's on Mastodon : [@gklyne@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@gklyne), I'll ping him there.*

ClaudioB's question is the kind of message I want my #:hyperdata systems to be able to deal with automatically.

Here's how this human agent is handling it :

---

**[prompt]**

> Is there a live instance of Semem?

**[me]**

* immediate response, "not yet"
* reformulate question in terms of concrete requirements
->
1. (functioning, good-enough) Semem
2. hosting
3. deployment infrastructure

For 1 : all I really need to do right away is minor bugfixing and whatever's needed to use existing online LLMs
For 2 : I've got a live Ubuntu server (which you are looking at now) and a domain name registered for a related plan, some nginx proxying already in place.  
For 3 : I've got a Docker container in-progress for this stuff, [tbox](https://github.com/danja/tbox)

* meta-reasoning - evaluate this against existing dev paths, consider priorities, time needed etc

On this point there's a green flag to go ahead, it's near-enough in line with what I was planning to do already, slight rearrangement of immediate priorities.

---

I acted in several roles there. Humans are good at this. I want a community of independent autonomous intelligent agents (on #:kia).

Ops. Azzurra just reminded me that I've an appointment with her up at the comune at 15:00. Now 13:12. Clever Azzurra has me sussed. I'd completely forgotten. But she's given me just the right amount of time to pop this online, take Claudio out for a short walk, find some clean clothes & have a wash.  

## Soon...

Somewhere around my vocabs I need terms for this particular kind of input. I may already have something like **Feature Request** around the project management oriented bits, but it totally ties in with agent-oriented messaging.

* #:todo fix #:semem failing on UPDATE
* #:todo tease next steps from `semem/docs/description_2024-12-30/`

I sorted out the UPDATE.


* #:todo deploy to #:tbox

* #:todo #:spike for function/action calling a la ReAct

* #:todo some FOAF

install the willison-mentioned UI tool - has useful bits for APIs?

ditto LibreChat
