# Rees-Mogg

Glorious description of Jacob Rees-Mogg from Matthew Parris on BBC Radio 4 just now :
```
He was pantomime in the House of Commons.
Bar staff's idea of a gentleman.
A shin-kicker, under the table.
Basically, he's the stupid person's idea of an intelligent person.
```

Before I got up I did a bit more #:ontops for #:ns related to #:transmissions and *all the things*. Modeling file access, the aim being to decouple from using a filesystem. Good start, but I'm sick of copy & pasting from Claude. The `src/applications/claude-json-converter` doesn't yet handle Claude Artifacts, so I've just been moving towards adding support.

I need to pull out the relevant JSON nodes. It's looks like the are `` I'd already made `src/processors/json/Blanker.js` to give a simple view of confusing JSON structure like Claude's `conversations.json`. I just got Claude to tweak it to preserve some values. so it'll
Ran out of Claude tokens for now. Dogwalk time.

Where the pre() & post() thing?

This needs flagging up better :
```sh
| Running >>> :  (SD.p10) BLK a Blanker
* Warn : Processor.getPropertyFromMyConfig(), property not defined : http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/preserve
```

Ops, a breakage slipped in :
```sh
 ./trans claude-json-converter.nop
```
runs all the transmissions.

```turtle
:ccc40 a :JSONWalker ;
     trm:configKey :messagesConfig .

#####

     t:MessagesWalker a trm:ServiceConfig ;
         trm:key t:messagesConfig ;
         trm:pointer "content" .
```

 should be :

```turtle
:ccc40 a :JSONWalker ;
     trm:config :messagesConfig .

#####

     t:messagesConfig a trm:ProcessorConfig ;
         trm:pointer "content" .
```

1. `TransmissionsBuilder` bits?
2. #:xyz rename  `trm:ServiceConfig` ->  `trm:ProcessorConfig`
