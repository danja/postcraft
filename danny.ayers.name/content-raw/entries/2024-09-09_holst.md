# The Planets

On BBC Radio 4 this morning there was a prog [How to Play](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0022t6x) featuring Holst's 'The Planets'.

Gives me today's analogy for my recurring problem of how best to spend my time.

My todo list for today might well be changed if some money I'm hoping is coming my way arrives today, but for now I'll assume it isn't.

I want to get XMPP up and running asap but I've got to a point with #Postcraft where I can start organising my notes better (and putting them online).

## Postcraft/Transmissions

Hmm. JSON remodeller, RDF->JSON lib for ConfigMap etc. Use the old thing

- write a top-level list of what I'm working on
- set up placeholder Postcraft setups as appropriate

[markmap-lib](https://markmap.js.org/docs/packages--markmap-lib)

TODO Postcraft backup transmission
TODO Transmissions conditionals (+ list other constructs somewhere)
TODO todo list extractor

TODO markmap interactive page

## XMPP
