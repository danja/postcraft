# Brrrm

_I just got a phone call for a survey about traffic in Rome. And it's cold again._

I spent a little time on #:transmissions module loading earlier. Just now did a new install of #:pulsar, and luckily it picked up the bits from `~/.pulsar`. No rush to update #:hyperdata-desktop.

A little bit more setup of #:semem, finally it let me install #:Jasmine.

Naturally I've added a bit more to the todos, but more of a priority shift than anything really new. The #:ns stuff is pressing, as is #:farelo, specifically #:fam.

I really want to crack on with applications, but the #:transmissions module stuff (& refactoring) is a bit of a blocker.

Heh, and there is also _hookers_ in progress...
