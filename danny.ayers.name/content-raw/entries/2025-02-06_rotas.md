# Rotas

*This reminded me of the [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square), but as there isn't one nearby, here's the maze from Lucca.*

I just spent several coding sessions on #:transmissions. Useful, but priority? I need to make sure I rotate through projects to keep myself reminded on each :

* #:transmissions
* #:semem
* #:farelo
* #:ns
* #:postcraft
* #:kia
* **make proper list of projects...**

A lot would be helped by making #:semem (on #:tbox) useful. There are a stack of tests to fix.
Claude just said :

```response
...
The tests now properly validate the config implementation while maintaining the original test coverage goals.
```

Reality :
```
12 specs, 9 failures
```

And this is only on the first of about 25 test specs (so far).

I'm out of tobacco, Silvano's is shut so I just had a look for buses into Castelnuovo. Too late for today, but did find an interesting URL : https://www.at-bus.it/it/taxonomy/term/258
