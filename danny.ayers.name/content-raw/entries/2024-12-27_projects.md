# Projects

Project docs are a priority for me right now. But interdependencies are crazy-convoluted.

First problem is identifying the projects...

Most of the things I've been most active with recently are still early-stage as Claude projects and/or on notes I've got scattered around, or in repos which appear two dirs on my office machine. I'll get back to that later.

First I need to remind myself where I was up to with :

* #:tbox - a Docker container for *stuff*, most relevant right know, **knowledgebases**
* #:semem - a **knowledgebase interface**

## tbox

Hah! I'd got further than I remembered. The Job One [Fuseki SPARQL Server](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) is already in place. Exposed at http://localhost:4030

Looks like I got [Prosody IM Server](https://prosody.im/) in there too, but I'm pretty sure I haven't tested.

I need to get #:transmissions and other core #:hyperdata projects in here too.

Because I need #:semem to organise my existing docs.

**I saved a link about setting up Docker as a dev container, best read that first.**

## semem

Dog walk now, coffee with Mari & plumbing supplies run soon.
