# Cough to Sneeze

I seem to have got over the cough/cold I had. Head still a bit fuzzy, but after one good cough when I woke up, all seems fine. Now snuffling a bit with hay fever...

## Plan

- Decommission server

Ok, if I tweak find-big-files a little, I should be able to save some time:

```
find ./ -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -30 | awk '{print "rm " $2}' > bigfiles.sh
```

I'll manually check the script before running it in case it's picking up anything I want to keep.

Ok, sweet.

Now :

```
tar -czvf server-decommission-2024-05_root.tar.gz /root
chmod 777
```

and locally:

```
time scp danny@178.79.136.35:/zips/server-decommission-2024-05_root.tar.gz ./
```

oops
wrong dir - move to `/zips` and try again

hah, that was tiny.

Now, `/home` - doesn't have many big files, and most of those are in `.git` dirs. I'll just delete those.

```
find ./ -type d -name '.git' > gits.sh
...
tar -czvf server-decommission-2024-05_home.tar.gz /home
```

```
time scp danny@178.79.136.35:/zips/server-decommission-2024-05_home.tar.gz ./
```

`var` - virtually all big files were under `log`, `lib` or `cache`. I reckon I'm safe in just deleting those.

```
tar -czvf server-decommission-2024-05_var.tar.gz /var
```

Hmm. There was a lot under `/var/www/html` as expected. What I'd forgotten about is all the `webdav` stuff for Joplin.

That's a pain, I want to reuse that, but I seem to remember Joplin having a weird format in its `.md` files.

```
time scp danny@178.79.136.35:/zips/server-decommission-2024-05_var.tar.gz ./
```
