# LDAP bits

Main objective today is to put #LDAP authentication on a #Fuseki server.

I've already got both running, apparently ok, on hyperdata.it

[Apache Directory Studio](https://directory.apache.org/studio/) seemed the obvious management client. Running locally, it looks like it's seeing the server fine.

Ok, I'll start at the LDAP end, I do need to refresh my memory on this stuff. Something simple in relative isolation before I think about Fuseki. A signup/login form.

_Copilot autosuggested from my miskeying: Chtulu, I mean Fuseki, is running on port 3331. I'll try to get a simple LDAP client running on the same machine._

> I have an Ubuntu server with LDAP running. I also have nginx running on the same machine. I'd like to make a simple sign-up login form, using nodejs on the server. I have Apache Directory Studio running locally for LDAP management.
> Where do I start?

ChatGPT gave me a reasonable-looking starting point.

I've stuck it on GitHub at https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-node, locally :

`~/HKMS/hyperdata-node`

on server

`root@hyperdata:/home/www/hyperdata.it# ln -s /home/github/hyperdata-node ./nodes`

Oops, I've already got a `~/HKMS/node-services`, has `.git`. Hey ho, merge them later.

I just remembered [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) for managing nodejs services. Used it before, was straightforward.

I had another look at the bits above, it seems there was a better approach than `ldapjs`, not least because that's deprecated.

[Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) seems to be the way to go.

This time I'll use my earlier `~/HKMS/node-services`, wipe that newer one.

Hooray! after another hour with Cursor I've got LDAP signup & login forms that work.

Boo! It's still inserted the deprecated `ldapjs` library.

It's possible that the `passport-ldapauth` lib depends on `ldapjs`, but whatever, this'll do for now.
