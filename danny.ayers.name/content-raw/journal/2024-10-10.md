# Journal : 2024-10-10

Ok, bit of self-discipline, resume using :

```
[project]/postcraft/content-raw/journal/[date].md
```  

for jotty notes, rather than overloading :

```
danny.ayers.name/content-raw/entries/[date]_title.md
```  

which should only contain more coherent bloggish posts.

#:todo tweak `danny.ayers.name/content-raw` etc to make it consistent with subsequent projects - as `server/danny.ayers.name/postcraft` may be best, `server` will contain new static stuff to be published...

16:04 and I've mostly been on boring admin tasks, slowly.

## Google Storage

Shite UX Demo #â„µ0+1
High on my list was sorting out my data on Google. I've known it needed doing for weeks, but today my Gmail stopped working. I had increased my storage space twice because the Inbox was full. More recently I unintentionally signed up for backup from my phone. When I realised the $leakage I cancelled that, leaving me just over the limit.

#:adhd innit.

Got very distracted this afternoon. Just back from dogwalk #2. An engineer is coming to fix up net antenna tomorrow morning, so I urgently need to make the kitchen less of a pigsty, the office less alienpigsty.

So I'm just having an hour trying out Ionic/Capacitor, see how far I get making an audible ping app.
