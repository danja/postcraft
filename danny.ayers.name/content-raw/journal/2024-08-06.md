# Coolbag

Mari dropped off some food for me that someone had given her.

First today I'd better finish off `/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft-site/articles/new-application-walkthrough.md`

The disorganisation of my docs is doing my head in.

If I get that ^^^ going, add doc indexing

I also need to look into other interaction paradigms for working with AI - beyond Chat (with doc) etc.

A piece of #Farelo is really gnawing at my brain. The task-alignment part.

I also need to get #LibreChat set up before I go much further.

**LibreChat** - look if there are any bits of it I can use with transmissions, AND see if I can attach it to transmissions
