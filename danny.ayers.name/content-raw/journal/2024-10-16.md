# Journal 2024-10-16

Main tasks today:

1. #:todo make #:fam usable with #:pivot vocab
2. #:todo make GitHub summary transmission #:transmission to list my GitHub repos and download key bits
3. #:todo start 'what I've been up to' doc using 2.
4. #:todo #:transmission to run #:postcraft installs to create placeholders as appropriate on `hyperdata.it/2004`, `elfquake.org` etc. (`server` repo?)

#:todo make server/browser extn for #:hyperdata-desktop

#:todo make #:t:processor for pulling out dirs of Claude projects, add to corresponding #:postcraft installs

## 1. FAM

### Getting a server/browser into the build workflow


```sh
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server --loglevel verbose
```

It appeared to stall, turns out :

```sh
...
npm verbose reify failed optional dependency /home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/farelo/form-a-matic/node_modules/fsevents
npm http fetch POST 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk 549ms
npm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/compressible/-/compressible-2.0.18.tgz 430ms (cache miss)
...
```
But finally -
```sh
added 169 packages, and audited 716 packages in 4m

104 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
npm verbose cwd /home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/farelo/form-a-matic
npm verbose os Linux 6.8.0-45-generic
npm verbose node v20.11.0
npm verbose npm  v10.9.0
npm verbose exit 0
npm info ok
```

Set up `package.json` & `webpack.config.js`



`html-webpack-plugin` also needed, non-verbose version did the stally thing again, need to check...

```sh
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin --loglevel verbose
```

Good breakpoint for dogwalk.

Hang on, it's installed, got this again :

```sh
npm verbose reify failed optional dependency /home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/farelo/form-a-matic/node_modules/fsevents
```

#:todo ignore optionals

#:todo check `webpack --mode production`
#:todo later -

<blockquote>
**Key performance optimizations**

* Use production mode: webpack --mode production
* Enable code splitting for larger apps
* Implement tree shaking to eliminate dead code
* Use mini-css-extract-plugin for CSS optimization
* Implement caching strategies for faster rebuilds
</blockquote>

When I got back to the actual code I made the usual mistake of asking Claude to do too much at once. 2 steps forward, 3 back. But finally moved things along a tiny bit, enough for today.

So the goal of being able to use it with #:pivot will haveto carry over.

## 2. GitHub summary transmission

#:next download, *if exists* :
* `README.md`
* `package.json`
* `about.md`
* `about.ttl`
* `manifest.ttl`

I have a #:t:processor for HTTP GET - did I use `axios` for client?

#:todo make a #:transmission to take repo summary raw, send to AI API, create a new `about.md`

#:todo make #:l{Make link markup resolver}

#:l{JSP Semtags} https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/sewese/api/semtags/tld-summary.html  "SemTags is a semantic web tags library that allows JSP developers to use (and work with) RDF/S and OWL ontologies and annotations in their JSP pages."

#:todo check [JSP Semtags](https://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/sewese/api/semtags/tld-summary.html) - there are bits that might be useful in #:t

#:todo add support for **includes** in #:transmissions's `manifest.ttl`

#:todo:ui [HTML details blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) markdown #:t:processor
