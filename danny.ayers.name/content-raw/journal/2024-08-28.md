# MAA's birthday

I went on a bit of a tangent with project vocab, but I have a plan there, to be continued when I have access to Claude again.

I just tried rendering blog - oops:

```
 ./run postcraft /home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
 ...
 [Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/manifest.ttl'] {
```

Silly me, I moved it...

```
/home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/manifest.ttl
./run postcraft ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

I'd better do a bit more on #globbo application.

Ok, I'm past the bug I had there. Can leave that for now.
