Ops!

Sorry for being so tardy with this mail, my head's not been right (nothing to worry about). It's long and rambly so I've put it in sections with footnotes for digestibility.

(Ops is Italian for Oops. I've started using it because a lot of what I do gets called something like sysops, devops... system operations, development operations etc.)

I've got a tablet lined up for you on Amazon which I'm convinced you'll find very useful (& fun). But it'll have to be paid for on your card. I've got the card details, but a confirmation number will be sent to your phone.
Call me once to let me know you're ready. Hang up and I'll place the order. Then call me again when you get the confirmation code (a minute or two later).

### Lots about my head

I had a routine psychiatrist visit 4? [1^] weeks ago. I mentioned how stressed I'd got on the UK trips, she prescribed me a new pill for anxiety (Paroxitina, an SSRI antidepressant).

Not good. My anxiety hasn't been a problem under normal circumstances recently [2^], so I was a bit skeptical. But it was worse than useless. It *massively* amplified the distractibility/unfocussed side of my ADHD, making it impossible for me to do some priority things. It was really stressing me - high anxiety! - so I took the strategy of calling it a win if I was doing anything. I have actually been pretty busy & productive, just on things either way down the to-do list or new projects.

Any benefits of SSRIs only appear after taking them for a while, so I waited to see if I'd level out. But it became obvious that was not going to happen. So a couple of days ago I started reducing the dose (have to with SSRIs), today I won't have any. I'm almost back to normal.

Extra annoying is that, in a way, it's been interesting and to some extent useful. Since my diagnosis the Ritalin and changes I've made to the ways I approach things have meant the weird traits have been minimised. But this stuff took it to the max. I'm not entirely convinced of the textbook explanation of what happens with ADHD, talk of 'executive function' [3^], but it's near enough. My head's been racing with ideas, many unusually good ones, very creative. Problem is they've been all over the place and fleeting.

*But*, a key part of my long-term uber-project is to make it easy to capture such ideas (and anything else that needs noting) in a systematic fashion. I've got the essentials of that part sorted. So I can quickly spit out the passing thoughts in a way that'll make it easier to use them later (I have a clear plan on how to exploit such material, but it'll be a little while before I've written that part of the code).

Examples of them Good Ideas :

* hinged extension to my desk with drawers underneath, on castors so it can be pushed back when not in use (I've got what I need in my salvaged wood stack)
* FitBit watch-style health (& location) tracker (with remotely-controllable camera) to go on Claudio's collar (I've got most of the parts and code I used for a synth project that I can reuse)
* make my pipeliney data processing system (core part of lots of my stuff) Turing Complete. This means it can be considered a general-purpose programming language, which is fun, and will look great in my portfolio.
* a paper : "Agile Software Development in the Age of AI" (I've a strong background in dev methodologies, am now using AI all the time when I'm coding)
* a book that might actually have a chance of selling : "ADHD for Computer Scientists" (lighthearted but academically sound, with tips)
* a (gentle) activism initiative, working title "Homepage First", to encourage people to self-publish online to help avoid getting sucked into the bad bits of social media.

### Mozz gossip

Pier-Ugo has left Tiziana (dunno when, Mari mentioned it yesterday when we were talking about Verbo the cat).

### Oriana & No.7

I like her - she's very amiable, good-hearted, and creative. But she's also a bit odd. Seems to have tendency to complicate her own life, and that's exacerbated by having an ex-husband who sounds a complete tool (I don't think she's properly settled into them being split up, but from what she's said I can't imagine them getting back together).

A week-ish? [1^] ago she returned from about a month in Switzerland. I didn't understand quite why she went up there - her husband was up there with the kids, but she said she only actually saw them for a couple of days. But did get well-paid work while she was there, dishwashing at a tourist hotel up in the mountains (well-paid dishwashing? Yeah - Switzerland innit).  

Latest is she's moving down to Siena (probably). She took a carload of stuff down last night (2 hour drive). The husband's down there and the kids have started school there - they like it. Right now she's staying with a friend nearby. She's already found some work to be going on with (mornings, as a carer for an old woman), got a place of her own lined up for 15th Oct.

She's paid up for No.7 until the middle of Nov, so I don't have to think about it until then.

Aside from a fragment at the start, I haven't seen any of the rent, it's all gone on house stuff - roof repairs & gas connection. But net-net it's still been great for me. Revived the house.
Yesterday she said she was going to move all her stuff into the back room for now (I haven't looked yet). So if I do find another tenant they house will be usable. (Well nearly, this has flagged up a few odd jobs I need to do to get it properly in order). I've told her that as she's paid up for time she's not going to be there, assuming I haven't got anyone else in, she's welcome to use the place.   

### Marinella

She's fine, except been tiring herself out a lot recently. She gets up early anyway, but has been decorating.

Her friend Anna has been helping her, and I did some ceiling the other day. Yesterday I did a fun little job for her. Next door along from her front door is where she keeps wood. But it also has her father's safe in the back wall. No key, I must figure out how to pick it, who knows what might be in there. Mari suspects a lot of now-useless Lire...
There's a door between that room and Mari's downstairs, but it's been blocked on the safe side. What looked like a painted board with a steel door behind it. My job was to open the door. I was pretty sure I'd be able to do it, worst case using an angle grinder. But once I'd got the board off, the metal turned out to be tin-can thickness screwed down. It still took me ages to remove that. Many screw heads blocked with paint, I had to use pliers on them.
Once that was off, it turned out what looked like a high security door was only really locked by being screwed down to the frame. Funny.   

The climbing gym in Pieve has closed, but the same folks are opening a bigger one in Gallicano tomorrow, open day, Mari's offered to take me down. But there's also an open day ("Miciofesta" = "Pussy Party" *snigger*) at a big cat shelter in Camaiore, which she wants a look at. So the plan is to see the cats first, climbing on the way back. (Though there's a good chance she might have gone off the long drive down to Camaiore, tiredness).

She's currently got her 2 original cats, had another adoptee Chiacchiera (chatter(er) because he was very talkative) and has recently been looking after Verbo, long story...

[1^]: I do have pretty bad time blindness, but usually I'm ok with recent events. The past few weeks I was having trouble placing events that only happened a day or so previous.
Funny related thing the other day. I was searching for a blog post I did ages ago, had some links I needed. Google's top hits were mostly the books. I did reckon they were the stand-out concrete experience I had on my CV. But the covers... I look ridiculously young! Bugger me, how long ago was it!? I only recognised myself on the first one I did a chapter for because I'd got a daft pose.

[2^]: The rest of the medication I'm on is neither here nor there, but I find Ritalin really helpful. It's a (speed-related) stimulant, in typical people it raises adrenalin etc, would boost any anxiety. But paradoxically it often makes people with ADHD calmer (it's considered a kind of post-diagnosis diagnostic). I get that. I have a couple of pills when ther alarm wakes me at 9:57 (time for a pee and a glass of water before Radio 4 news), an hour later I'm calm & clear-headed. I still need a strong coffee (which does stimulate me) to get going, but the bed-pull has majorly dropped off.  

[3^]: I asked Claude AI to summarise 'executive function' in this context. It's a long summary, and my own traits are a slight variation (re. 3 - I've recently discovered I'm extremely good at switching tasks when I plan for it - Duolingo!) but you might as well have it :
[[
Executive function refers to a set of cognitive processes that help us manage, control, and regulate our thoughts and actions. These processes are crucial for goal-directed behavior, planning, and decision-making. In the context of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), executive function is often impaired, leading to various challenges.

Key aspects of executive function that are often affected in ADHD include:

1. Working memory: The ability to hold and manipulate information in mind over short periods.

2. Inhibitory control: The capacity to suppress inappropriate responses or irrelevant information.

3. Cognitive flexibility: The ability to switch between tasks or adapt to new situations.

4. Planning and organization: Skills needed to create and follow through on plans.

5. Time management: The ability to estimate time, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines.

6. Emotional regulation: The capacity to manage and modulate emotional responses.

7. Task initiation: The ability to start tasks without excessive procrastination.

8. Self-monitoring: The skill of assessing one's own performance and behavior.

People with ADHD often struggle with these executive functions, which can manifest as:

- Difficulty staying focused on tasks
- Impulsivity in actions or decision-making
- Challenges in organizing tasks and managing time
- Trouble following multi-step instructions
- Difficulty regulating emotions
- Problems with prioritization and completing tasks

Understanding executive function deficits in ADHD is crucial for developing effective interventions and support strategies. Treatment often involves a combination of medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, and skill-building exercises targeting specific executive function areas.
