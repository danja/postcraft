Nick:
Visited Mary earlier.  Things not good at all.  I think itâ€™s a matter of days not weeks.

Anne:
Your mum had a fall on Friday night and as a result she has become more confused and her speech is now impaired. If you want to know more details, I suggest you phone the care home. Mary Jo emailed to say that she is visiting this week and today Jonathan and Joan went to see her

Anne (later):
I wish I had better news, Danny. However, your mum is comfortable and not showing any signs of distress. She likes the staff who care for her and we have to take the positives where we can find them.
