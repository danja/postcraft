Mother news - I got a short email from Mary Jo, she's arrived ok. Nothing about my mother we didn't already know.

Just now a message from cousin Neil (who is reliable for information when he has it, direct) :
[[Just took Mary Jo over to the care home place. MJ is in with Mary.  Mary quite perked up for it.
Explicit statement of fact now…. If you want to see Mary again you probably need to get your skates on.
She would like to see you.]]
He also included a message from "Phil of the home Phisician service" (?) : [[I’ve been to review your mum, significant decline in health. Fall with drowsiness and altered speech, internal bleeding. Mum currently has some abdominal discomfort which we have medication to help with. Seems brighter today but time could be limited. We have measures in place to keep your mum comfortable.]]
