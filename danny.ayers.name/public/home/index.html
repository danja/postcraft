    <h1>Homepage[^1] First</h1>
<p><em>I&#39;ll use this post as my sample for This Site Requires below</em></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve written this down anywhere yet, although the core idea certainly isn&#39;t new [^2].</p>
<p>Instead of automatically posting material to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.., post it in a space you control first. Only then share any of <strong>your own content</strong> on the big $-motivated platforms. And only share as little or as much as you want to, on a case-by-case basis. Copy &amp; paste everything, get AI to write a summary, only post a link. <strong>Your choice</strong>.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve still not adopted the principle (? better word?) myself, despite having the provider of what you&#39;re looking at under my own control (cheapo quasi-bare metal virtual server, nginx and a bunch of node code). Aside from the elephant in the cyberspace that this site ain&#39;t much to look at (<em>yet!</em>), there are some key elements I need to work on a bit first :</p>
<h2>This Site Requires</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - firstly in the broadest sense, presenting this stuff in a form that will work ok for most people on common devices. But high on the list are using some of the techniques of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Web Accessibility</a> to remove tech obstacles that might limit the potential audience.</li>
<li><strong>Modalities</strong> - other aspects of the same kind of thing, focusing on supporting multiple devices, multiple media. I don&#39;t yet have a workflow for easily publishing video &amp; audio <em>Homepage First</em>. Very low-hanging fruit in this domain is giving the site a feed : Atom format first (because I was on the WG, I think it&#39;s the only RFC with my name in it).</li>
<li><strong>SEO (Ho-ho-ho)</strong> - page metadata, rich snippety things, so that links posted to the platforms, search results etc. have a decent preview</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m framing <strong>Homepage First</strong> as a (lazy<sup><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#footnote-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>) campaign. I&#39;ll do a proper <em>launch</em> when I&#39;ve got my systems set up to capture comments etc. (This will be lazy<sup><a id="footnote-ref-3" href="#footnote-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> again - I&#39;ll just post a link here and there. I&#39;ve given myself an artificial deadline of 2024-10-31 for announcing the release of a load of <em>unfinished</em> work, I&#39;ll chuck this in).</p>
<h3>Footlings</h3>
<p>[1^]: &#39;Homepage&#39; was best <em>(but still not great)</em> signifier for the space I could come up with was &#39;Homepage&#39;. I bet the proportion of people that knows what that means has actually <em>declined</em> over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>[2^]: Related material will appear around here soon. I currently have documenting specific bits of history (<strong>#:FOAF!</strong>) as a priority job. But the whole <em>milieu-milieu</em> around trends in social media, the Web and tech at large and the status of <strong>Open Social</strong> (as a good-enough umbrella term) is due a revisit, so my todo list is a bit broader.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, I also dislike <strong>&#39;upcycling&#39;</strong>. Ok, the principle sounds ok - recycling and adding value (eg. environmental or artistic). But if you&#39;re making something, using recycled materials and being environment-friendly should be the defaults, not <strong>virtue-signaling nonsense</strong> over using a feather to repaint an ugly plain vase to make it an uglier decorated vase.
Oh yeah, and <strong>&#39;proactive&#39;</strong>, what is that beyond management babble meaning <strong>active</strong>. Ok, like &#39;hacktivism&#39; and &#39;upcycling&#39; I suppose it has value in <strong>wankiness-signalling</strong>.   </p>
<section class="footnotes" data-footnotes>
<h2 id="footnote-label" class="sr-only">Footnotes</h2>
<ol>
<li id="footnote-3">
<p>I do have strong views on quite a lot of things, but simply can&#39;t be bothered doing much beyond living my life the way I do, occasionally stating my position and/or trolling on Twitter. Passive-activism (including inacto-pacifism). Also <strong>I dislike the term &#39;hacktivism&#39;</strong>. In the current socio-politico-economic climate, hacking (in every sense except the nasty rip-off stuff) is inherently a form of activism. Fixing your own music system, making your own gadgets, all are a form of non-violent direct action.

    <h1>Brrr!</h1>
<p>It&#39;s chilly in the house, raining outside.</p>
<p>I worked on some ideas for #:transmissions with Claude on phone in bed, only just got up, 13:30. Coffee was necessary.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve set myself #:pivot:spooky for 2024-10-31, basically release a v1 alpha of <em>everything</em>. An artificial deadline to help me get things done.</p>
<p>Big problem now, I need a system for prioritizing tasks in the <strong>massive todo graph</strong>.</p>
<p>One of my key projects is just such a system : #:farelo. But it&#39;s not yet usable...</p>
<p>To start it bootstrapping me, I first need to capture project information.</p>
<h2>Form-a-matic</h2>
<p>#:fam code generator to make custom forms is <strong>Top Priority</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve got the <em>offline</em> node bits working ok : you provide a pseudo-Turtle template for a given vocab. This is converted to an intermediate (#:yars) JSON representation, next that is used to generate the HTML form.</p>
<p>After filling out the form and clicking a button, a Turtle representation of the fields should be presented. The form uses a script called <code>extractor.js</code>.</p>
<p>The issue right now is that I&#39;m using a couple of libs written for node, made browser-friendly by #:tools:webpack. But debugging is really painful. I&#39;ve not been in quite this situation before so I don&#39;t even really know what tooling is available. This might be a one-off, so I can&#39;t really justify the time needed to learn new kit and integrate it into my workflow.</p>
<p>But my best guess as where the bugs are most likely to be is :</p>
<ol>
<li>my code (written with much help from #ai:claude)</li>
<li>code/lib integration for browser</li>
<li>libs</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1, as it happens, I&#39;ve barely touched one particular first-line approach : tests! Because of the node/browser lib issue, I reckon I&#39;ll try kind-of mocks.</p>
<p>Unit tests for methods will be needed. But to prepare Claude to make these, a quasi-integration test seems a good place to start.</p>
<p>Take a rendered HTML form file, fill in sample data as preset values, this is the mock. In node, by read the HTML file into a <code>document</code> model in #:tools:jsdom, check the operation of <code>extractor.js</code> with that.
Prompt time.</p>

<p>Hmm. Yes, that&#39;s old!</p>
<p>Hah, I couldn&#39;t remember it&#39;s name <strong><a href="https://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a></strong>. Ok, I still have a login <em>dannyayers</em>. &#39;Joined 2000-12-23 16:33:37&#39;.
Wonder what&#39;s there...  </p>
<p>Two projects I&#39;d completely forgotten about :</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jemblog/">JemBlog</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Sourceforge project was initially set up to publish JemBlog (RDF-backed server-side blogging). It&#39;s drifted: there is the Stiki Wiki which is RDF-backed, and there will also be some RDF API material (&quot;Sambuca&quot;) following in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Registered 2003-02-14</p>
<p>It drifted a lot. This direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/knobot/">KnoBot</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>WYMIWYG KnoBot is a content management system for the semantic web designed to promote the exchange of content with a P2P and reputation based system. The aim is to create a socio-topical space, a perspective dependent space of information and knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Registered 2003-06-10</p>
<p>I believe that was @retobg&#39;s project. Last activity on SourceForge, <code>.jar</code> releases, 10 years ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040324040012/http://dannyayers.com/2003/09/17/sketch.svg">https://web.archive.org/web/20040324040012/http://dannyayers.com/2003/09/17/sketch.svg</a></p>
<p>TurtleEditor  - used canvas</p>
<p>I made another new repo : <a href="https://github.com/danja/store-wrapper.git">store-wrapper</a></p>
<p>I had a GitHub notification related to this :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/semanticarts/gist">Gist</a> is Semantic Arts&#39; minimalist upper ontology for the enterprise. It is designed to have the maximum coverage of typical business ontology concepts with the fewest number of primitives and the least amount of ambiguity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linked from there, omg, this : <a href="https://semantechs.co.uk/turtle-editor-viewer/">https://semantechs.co.uk/turtle-editor-viewer/</a></p>
<p>Also - <a href="https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco">https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco</a> - rather a capable ont doc toolset. I have uses for that...</p>
<p><a href="https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/doc/gallery/">https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/doc/gallery/</a></p>
<p>Sweet!</p>
<p>Nice touch - including markdown in <code>rdfs:comment</code>, having it render in the ont doc. Guess who&#39;s going to steal that idea...</p>
<p>Notification re. <a href="https://solidproject.org">https://solidproject.org</a> - all that&#39;s already on my todo list somewhere.</p>

    <h1>Wordy</h1>
<p>#:next Friday is Collation Day!!!</p>
<p>#:next proper runner of Fork didn&#39;t quite work, also need to mod all processors for <code>simples</code></p>
<p>#:next try out <code>engine/ModuleLoader.js</code> (docs inside it) for remote processors</p>
<p>Because before getting out of bed I was catching up with WordNet.</p>
<p>I was on a roll yesterday, had a fairly productive coding session until late. Made good progress with #:simples, the minimal #:transmission runner. Main requirement turned out to be trivial, simply return the processed <code>message</code> from <code>processor.execute(message)</code>. For the processors I tried, it Just Worked.</p>
<p>But after sleeping on it, I&#39;ve realised there&#39;s a little snag - processors that fork, like <code>DirWalker</code> currently spawn lots of pipelines, emitting <code>message</code> to each. But how to cover that with <code>simples</code>.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve got processor <code>Fork</code> as a starting point to play with.  </p>
<p>remember I need videos for Spooky release - and music! #:music:tasty</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing quite a few real-world odd jobs. Now tired &amp; hungry, but still on a roll...</p>

<h2>3D UI a bit like zz structure</h2>
<p>Use a games engine?</p>
<h3>main window :</h3>
<p>projection of a higher-dimension graph, vector store/LOD</p>
<p>3D cuboid nodes connected with straight line edges. Each with summary info</p>
<h3>nav sidebar :</h3>
<p>pan, move, zoom buttons etc</p>
<p>when focused on a given node A there is are lists of nearby (vector) and linked (rdf) nodes</p>
<p>choosing one or more from the list, B, C modifies the viewpoint/axes, making related ones more visible.   </p>
<h3>tools sidebar</h3>
<p>rendering styles, with params</p>
<p>params for weightings, so the vector index has a greater/lesser role than the RDF</p>
<p>SPARQL to filter visible</p>
<hr>
<p>#:md:rdf - thought for #:yars</p>
<p>Default <code>#:</code> namespace will be defined somewhere locally, but namespaces can be changed/defined in an md doc. Maybe <code>#:ns:http://example.org</code> for <code>#:</code> and <code>#:ns:http://example.org/this:th</code> for prefixes.</p>
