<p>My essential daytime beverage is <strong>Caffé Americano, Macchiato, à la Turk</strong>.</p>
<p>In the UK I used to drink the classic <strong>Brit Instant</strong>. One or two spoonfuls of powder from a jar, in a mug, good splash of milk, spoonful of sugar. Of necessity, usually the cheap stuff, but Nescafé by preference and/or in posh company.
I can&#39;t bear the silage run-off now.</p>

<p>Christ on an e-bike, so many distractions today. Oriana just called, due up from Siena in 10 mins, asked if I can give her a hand shifting stuff.</p>

<p>Golly, via Duolingo, a name I believe I recognise from the distant past, #:foaf <a href="https://jtauber.com">James Tauber</a>. I can&#39;t place him yet, my mental sorting office will take a while to locate the relevant pile.  I doubt I know him through his main field, he does lots of Ancient Greek as <a href="https://jktauber.com">J.K. Tauber</a> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>at the intersection of computing, linguistics, philology, and learning science</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has written up <a href="https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web/">My History with the Web</a>, which mentions the W3C, may be a hint for the backend posties.
This project of his I must #:todo revisit : <a href="https://modelling-music.com">https://modelling-music.com</a></p>
<p>#:todo come up with a short #:semtag that I&#39;ll remember for check it out/revisit.</p>
<p>Reminds me, I need to see if I got around to doing one of these : <a href="https://linktr.ee/jtauber">https://linktr.ee/jtauber</a></p>
<p>His <em>History</em> is on <a href="https://thoughtstreams.io">https://thoughtstreams.io</a>, not sure I&#39;ve seen that before. But <strong>microblogging</strong> is very strongly in scope for <em>my stuff</em>, #:todo check it out. Over there the page has :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>get stream as: <a href="https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web.md">markdown</a> or <a href="https://thoughtstreams.io/jtauber/my-history-with-the-web.atom">atom</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Atom feed follows the usual reverse-chrono sequence of posts (which is kinda irrelevant, they are datetime-stamped). #:todo remember bloody Atom, is important here.</p>
<p>The Markdown feed is forward-chrono (which makes sense here, the <em>History..</em> is a sequential, self-contained article). Just the usual #:md syntax, with <code>---</code> (ie. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>) inserted as post separators.</p>
<p>Coincidentally I woke up this morning with a closely related thing on my mind, #:chunks or for here -</p>
<h2>Chunky Chunks</h2>
<p>I need dynamically modifiable, identifiable blocks of text.</p>

    <h1>Inpomnet</h1>
<p>My interweb connection has mostly been 0b/S since yesterday morning. Problem started coincident with a rainstorm. Almost certainly down to the antenna here being a bit out of line.</p>
<p>My service provider is generally pretty good, which is fortunate because right now they&#39;re the only real option for me here. Friendly &amp; helpful, but clearly short of field engineers - we are up in the  hills. (I&#39;ve been tempted to ping them about work even though I don&#39;t have transport - I get the feeling they might be desperate enough to find a workaround).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#:aside I was a total bookworm from an early age (until I moved to this harder drug when the Web came along). Odd really, I&#39;m not sure how it started. Even though both my parents were very hot on education, neither were big readers, not a bookish family. But incredibly lucky in how it opened the world to me. Anyhow, my English language mechanical skills got to be really good, I had automatic correct usage (I&#39;m crap at other languages, btw). But nowadays my spelling is... hesitant. The exposure to en-US online and a fair bit of Italian has scrambled it, I have to double check all the time. Ditto my grammar. Both understandable, I don&#39;t feel bad. But my bloody punctuation is broken too! Example just now ^^^, putting a whole sentence in braces. Where, by the Frenchman&#39;s f&#39;ing&#39; <em>fin</em> does the full stop/period go..?       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, what I have been working on (always) is heavily dependent on the Web. But I still have vast numbers of things to do which don&#39;t need it. No problem. Hah!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been fortunate in only having experienced sexual impotence a couple of times in my life, despite having a taste for the booze. Found it slightly embarrassing, very frustrating (tragic on a one-night stand). But that pales in comparison with having to wait, possibly a day or two, for an engineer to get here.</p>
<p>Claudio and I are not long back from walk #1, I&#39;ve just been getting my breath back. I noticed coming in that my antenna is <em>securely</em> mounted by means of cable ties to a drainpipe. So I&#39;m now going to get out the ladders and give it a wiggle. Even if I had a clue about what freqs it operates on it&#39;s unlikely I&#39;ve a suitable meter. But I do have <strong>ping</strong> (on termux) on my phone.  </p>
