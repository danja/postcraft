    <h1>Semem Fix &amp; Deploy</h1>
<p><strong>A little pause while I publish these scraps so I can tell Graham what reminded me of him.</strong></p>
<p>I made a todo list here yesterday without any explanation. Didn&#39;t publish. Invisible todo list is absolutely not what I want on my blog front page! My top priority this week is doc organisation, so I&#39;ll let myself off this time. I&#39;ve changed the date on the file, this is it I&#39;ll now fill it out...</p>
<p>I&#39;d had a chat with ClaudioB, pointed him to my notes so far on <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a>. He asked me if I had a <strong>live instance</strong> he could play with. A very good question! Not for the first time I&#39;ll quote -</p>
<h2>Connolly&#39;s Bane</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;The bane of my existence is doing things that I know the
computer could do for me&quot;</strong>
\â€“ Dan Connolly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Which reminded me I&#39;ve not been in touch with <a href="https://www.ninebynine.org/">Graham Klyne</a> for many years. A blog post of his drew my attention to that quote. Good-o, he&#39;s on Mastodon : <a href="https://indieweb.social/@gklyne">@gklyne@indieweb.social</a>, I&#39;ll ping him there.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pause</strong></p>
<p>It totally ties in with agent-oriented messaging. This is the kind of message I want my systems to be able to deal with automatically.
Somewhere around my vocabs I need terms for this particular kind of input. I may already have something like <strong>Feature Request</strong> around the project management oriented bits, but</p>

    type: &#39;literal&#39;,
    value: &#39;AI (artificial intelligence) technology has made significant strides in recent years, and its capabilities are now widely recognized. Here are some key developments:\n&#39; +
      &#39;\n&#39; +
      &#39;1. Machine Learning: This is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed to do so. There have been significant advancements in machine learning algorithms, making it easier for models to perform complex tasks.\n&#39; +
      &#39;\n&#39; +
      &#39;2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP allows machines to understand and interpret human language. This technology has advanced significantly, enabling chatbots and virtual assistants to more accurately communicate with users in natural languages.\n&#39; +
      &#39;\n&#39; +
      &#39;3. Computer Vision: Computer vision involves using cameras to capture visual information from the environment and converting it into digital images or video footage that can be analyzed. There have been significant improvements in this area, allowing machines to recognize objects, faces, and other elements within an image or video.\n&#39; +
      &#39;\n&#39; +
      &#39;4. Robotics: Robots are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with capabilities ranging from simple assembly line work to complex tasks like surgery and disaster response. These robots are using advanced sensors, machine learning algorithms, and AI to perform these tasks more efficiently and effectively.\n&#39; +
      &#39;\n&#39; +
      &quot;Overall, AI technology is continuing to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs in fields such as robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. As the field of artificial intelligence continues to advance, it&#39;s likely that we&#39;ll see even more impressive developments in the future.&quot;

Response: The semantic web has seen significant progress over recent years, driven by advancements in technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning. The current state of the semantic web is largely characterized by the development of standards and protocols that support the creation, exchange, and application of semantic data.

Some key areas of focus within the Semantic Web include:

1. **Semantically enriched information models**: The Semantic Web has evolved to incorporate rich and structured data formats such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data). These formats allow for more precise descriptions of resources in a web context, which can be crucial for semantic applications.

2. **Semantic integration services**: Tools like OWLonto are emerging to help developers automatically convert their ontologies into the OWL format, which is widely supported by Semantic Web technologies.

3. **Semantics-Driven Applications**: The Semantic Web has fostered the development of vast ecosystems of Semantic Web-based applications that can interact with each other and with external resources in a semantic way.

4. **Semantically Enhanced Data Access**: Technologies like SPARQL (SQL for Data) are increasingly being adopted to make data from RDF, JSON-LD, etc. easily accessible through standard SQL-like queries.

5. **Semantic Web Standards**: The development of standards such as Apache Jena and Neo4j continue to evolve the Semantic Web landscape by providing tools that support semantic data management, query processing, and other key tasks in the web.

6. **Semantic Web Applications**: There has been a significant increase in the number of commercial applications built using various Semantic Web technologies.

In summary, while there are still challenges and limitations within the Semantic Web landscape, it is now more widely adopted and utilized than ever before. Its potential for transforming how information is managed, shared, and used is becoming increasingly evident.

    <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
<p>Foggy brain yet again. Not for the first time on New Year&#39;s Day, but irritatingly I wasn&#39;t up all that late and didn&#39;t drink to excess. I did have fun last night, my first attempt at livestreaming. Around 7pm I was feeling blocked at desk (my head, not the code) and an idea formed in my head. I&#39;d been listening to Drum &amp; Bass. Didn&#39;t seem right, hmm, bagpipes? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjdnGNfDyd4">Big Bad Bollocks</a>? Pogues? Hang on, is there any D&amp;B in 3/4 or 6/8 time? I decided to make some. By midnight.    </p>
<p>Easiest camera to set up was my Android phone (after I spent half an hour sorting out a tripod). Perplexity suggested Facebook was the easiest platform, but neglected to tell me it has a very confusing UI with sod all settings accessible. Worst, whatever resolution/codec it uses, it&#39;s a network glutton. I&#39;m not sure how much actually got streamed, 50% of the times I checked it was waiting to connect.  </p>

    <h1>Semem POC</h1>
<p><em>First-thing morning ramblings, deep sea trawling for actionables again</em></p>
<p>I have two upcoming deadlines I&#39;ve set myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:PoggiPivot 2025-01-05 - get my #:hyperdata project docs sorted</li>
<li>#:ProofPivot 2025-01-14 - proofs of concept for projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Both racing towards me. But that&#39;s the whole idea, use the purely artificial urgency to motivate myself to <strong>focus</strong>. Success at achieving the goals is secondary, reflected in the fact I haven&#39;t actually written down those criteria yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, since setting these I&#39;ve made a good start on them for <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a> (Semantic Memory). Which has highlighted one particular flaw in my current processes, that <strong>proof of concept</strong> isn&#39;t actually the phrase I intended in the above.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere</em>, probably in a Claude project, hopefully condensed in a vocab, I have (work on) better terms. But I need to get my docs sorted...</p>
<p>The phrase is/should be closer to <strong>minimum viable product</strong>. But I don&#39;t like this phrase because <strong>product</strong> <em>in this context, in my mind</em> suggests a marketable commodity. As a dyed in the wool Capitalism-sceptic, I have a knee-jerk reaction to this kind of thing. In society at large there is an overarching conflation between a thing&#39;s value in a &quot;noble&quot; utilitarian sense and it&#39;s bottom line <strong>$ value</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Aside</strong> : I have a vague memory of having the same kind of reaction while tech-reviewing some book material by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Powers">Shelley Powers</a> a good few years ago. <em>(This may be a completely false memory, apologies to Shelley if that&#39;s the case, but it is plausible and moreover nicely fits this narrative, &quot;don&#39;t let the truth get in way...&quot; and all that).</em>  Shelley is one of my heros of the Web-tech world, and a bloody good writer. But in this particular chapter she made repeated use of phrases like &quot;business rules&quot;. Which I repeatedly criticised. There is a legitimate definition of &quot;business&quot; in this context, to paraphrase &quot;the important stuff&quot;. But still in my mind the conflation with business in the common-English commercial activity sense made my hackles rise. </p>
<p>(Btw, I am an experienced reviewer, and key to that role is drawing attention to text that <em>might not</em> be quite right. It might well be fine. But I&#39;d say the diligent reviewer should err a little on the side of caution, flag things where suspicions are raised. As an experienced writer, Shelley would know many of such flags were tentative, a legitimate response being to reject them after a cursory mental check - which she probably did in this instance, if it ever happened. For sure, iffy crit is a pain and any crit can be demoralising when you get a downpour (I&#39;d be one of many reviewers doing this). But the patience of Job and thick skin are job requirements.)</p>
<p>Any road... I do hope I did get some clear and accurate terminology nailed down for POC/MVC. Neutral language in the sense of not carrying misleading baggage. What I&#39;m after is more like &quot;demonstration of utility&quot;. <strong>Clunky, eh</strong>.</p>
<h2>Semem Demonstration of Utility</h2>
<p>I delighted myself with the hubris I got into my working description of #:semem :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a> is an LLM-compatible context-aware, open-ended graph knowledgebase system combining the advantages of vector embeddings and Linked Data technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what am I aiming for by 2025-01-14? I actually have an immediate use case with low-end requirements :</p>
<p><strong>A system I can point to my local FS containing scattered markdown notes etc etc so I can use the stuff efficiently.</strong></p>
<p>I reckon a baseline #:Semem needs to :</p>
<ul>
<li>provide simple similarity search</li>
<li>cluster related topics at different scales</li>
<li>create quasi-formalised annotation (metadata)</li>
<li>make a disorganised, heterogenous corpus addressable as a coherent entity</li>
<li>exploit LLMs (and maybe trad reasoning) to facilitate new knowledge discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, I have some actionables. Mari&#39;s picking me up in 15 mins to go for a coffee and I&#39;m not yet out of bed.</p>
