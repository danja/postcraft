    <h1>Rainsday</h1>
<p>It&#39;s pouring with rain, but I&#39;m hoping to be going out later. When Mari messages to say my meds prescription is ready to pick up, we&#39;ll go ut for that, do a bit of shopping and have a coffee. There&#39;s also a little panelling job for me to do at hers, when convenient.  </p>
<p>Before I got up I did a bit of exploration around formulas for determining task priorities, with much help from Claude AI on the phone. Got to v1 bits for #Farelo.</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<p><code>form-a-matic</code> first</p>
<p>get Claude to make a test for extractor.js, sim from form with jsdom</p>
<p><em>Interruption - trip into town.</em></p>
<p><code>form-a-matic</code>  is proceeding ok. But given the new TODOs below, I&#39;m inclined to procrastinate a little to make a little #productivity timesaver.</p>
<hr>
<p>A #:pain at the moment is the chain of run #:postcraft on projects -&gt; commit projects (in the correct order) -&gt; push -&gt; server pull. I&#39;d better have this as a #:transmission.</p>
<p>...oops, mind wandered from that #:adhd, heh.</p>
<p>Which calls for new processors. Docs can start in #:transmissions:processors (#:specs:md)</p>
<p>Ops, I see #:yars approaching - <strong>Yet another RDF syntax</strong>. I&#39;ve got notes on #md:rdf somewhere, #:todo:link. But this may have potential for quick &amp; dirty inline RDF, eg. #(anchor):seeAlso:<a href="http://url">link</a> ...hmmm...</p>
<ul>
<li><p><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> 
define #:specs:md for an arbitrary anchor for <em>incoming</em> links anywhere in a doc that can act as an #:XPointer style URL to use in HTML and inline/any RDF statements. Hang on, why not just something like #:.anchor-name</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get Claude to help me with my CV. Create a Project &quot;PR&quot; and add some of my small publication PDFs as <code>Project knowledge</code>.</p>
<p>Before anything else (but after making a coffee), I&#39;ll have an hour or so on #Farelo <code>form-a-matic</code>. That feels close to a working v1, soon should be very helpful for my productivity and also feeds a couple of nearby birds[^1].</p>

<p>[1^]:  &quot;pali wan, kama pini tu.&quot;</p>
<p>I just checked back on this :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1fgj8ae/kill_two_birds_with_one_stone/">https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1fgj8ae/kill_two_birds_with_one_stone/</a></p>
<p>There was a new suggestion. So I asked Claude :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the toki pona &quot;pali wan, kama pini tu.&quot; in English?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 The Toki Pona phrase "pali wan, kama pini tu." can be translated to English as:
 "Do one task, finish two."
 This phrase uses the following Toki Pona words:

<p> pali: work, do, make
 wan: one
 kama: to become, to arrive, to bring about
 pini: end, finish, complete
 tu: two</p>
<p> The meaning conveys the idea of efficiency or accomplishing more than expected - by doing one task, you end up completing two things. It&#39;s similar to the English saying &quot;killing two birds with one stone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Posted somewhere in the early hours last night</p>
<p>I really like sound of this version of &#39;Blue Monday&#39;,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLbaOLWjpc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLbaOLWjpc</a></p>
<p>but there are many, many things about the video that annoy me. A small sample :</p>
<ul>
<li>that&#39;s a cruddy monochord (I made one as a pressie for oor Nigel, much  more practical &amp; prettier)</li>
<li>the sig gen looks at least late 40s</li>
<li>voice short delay effect - how? It&#39;s generally taken that the first time an artificial reverb effect was used was in 1947. The producer&#39;s bathroom, for this : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIuX7IsdE8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIuX7IsdE8</a></li>
<li>where is the vocal chorus coming from? (Ok, magnetic wire recording had been around a while, tape was just emerging, you could overlay - but they were all really big machines, valve/tube electronics, I don&#39;t see one)</li>
<li>NO-ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS USES RUSTY STRINGS</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all these are coumterbalanced for me by intrigue on the 4-stringed hammered thing (what is that called?) and most of all by imagining - Stephen Morris drum roll, tss tss tss...</p>
<p>Peter Hook playing a banjolele.</p>
<p>(I&#39;ve actually got one, they are probably the most ridiculous instrument in human history. A meeting of the best engineering and craftwor., The end result having the worst features of both banjos and ukuleles.
I&#39;m guessing me dad found it in a charity shop. Has been desperately in need of repair for decades, this might be motivation for me to get around to it. Also the mandolin sharing the same cardboard box I got from a car boot sale years back, which had no back and a broken front, which I <em>did</em> resurrect - so badly it has needed gluing back together since a week after my fix- accursed kerfs!).</p>
<p>How does it feel?</p>

    <h1>Lively Distractions</h1>
<p><strong>2024-09-28</strong> Yesterday I was too busy doing things, head firing on way too many cylinders, so only wrote down reminders. I&#39;ll flesh them out a little now.</p>
<h2>Tibico Research</h2>
<p>Last month Oriana asked me to look after her jar of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibicos">Tibicos</a> aka <strong>water kefir</strong>. It&#39;s fascinating stuff, I&#39;ve already started experimenting. It also made a nice test case for using Claude AI&#39;s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects">Projects</a> for research. I had only used them for software projects, for which they are great (with the help of <a href="https://github.com/yamadashy/repopack">repopack</a>). I know virtually nothing about microbiology (though have been interested a while - I&#39;ve got a usable microscope etc), so this topic offered a good <em>virgin</em> project.    </p>
<p>I created the Project and set up a custom prompt. Then added the &#39;Edit&#39; raw text of the Wikipedia page on Tibicos and that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_boulardii">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> (a probiotic - that page is an interesting read), together with 4 papers linked from Wikipedia, to Project Knowledge.
It worked really well, I immediately had a useful expert on hand.  </p>
<p>I was curious how viable it might be to incorporate the probiotic critter into the existing symbiotic tibicos culture. Here&#39;s how the chat started :</p>
<p><img src="media/images/2024-09/claude-tibicos_1.png" alt="Claude Tibicos research screenshot 1"></p>
<p>By the 4th interaction we were at this :</p>
<p> <img src="media/images/2024-09/claude-tibicos_2.png" alt="Claude Tibicos research screenshot 1"></p>
<h2>Alife</h2>
<p>Thinking about real (little) life reminded me of alife. I had to have a play with Claude. Not long ago <a href="https://x.com/danbri">danbri</a> showed me things he&#39;d been able to build.</p>
<p>Claudio</p>
<h2>Farelo bits</h2>
<p>write requirements first!</p>
<p>convert into prompt if appropriate</p>
<p>farelo metrics</p>
<h2>sparql-store-lite</h2>
<p>Many of my [hyperdata](<a href="https://hyperdata.it%5D">https://hyperdata.it]</a> projects require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> store. I&#39;m in the process of setting up <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/">Fuseki</a> on my server. It&#39;s my go-to for self-hosted, very capable and straightforward to set up. (<a href="https://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/">Virtuoso</a> and <a href="https://www.ontotext.com">Ontotext</a> are among other out-of-the-box alternatives, but I&#39;ve also history of coding with <a href="https://jena.apache.org/">Apache Jena</a> libs on which Fuseki is built, so it&#39;s an obvious default).</p>
<p>Long-term, this time around I want to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">LDAP</a>-backed auth on my server which is taking a bit of time (I&#39;ve already had to hack a bit of connector code for <a href="https://shiro.apache.org/">Apache Shiro</a>. <em>I used to know Java, eh...</em>). I do have Fuseki running on my desktop, but while I was mulling this over I remembered that I&#39;m meant to be writing some docs for <a href="https://www.bergnet.org">Bergi</a>&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/rdf-ext">RDF-Ext</a>. For which I need to get familiar with it. A little file-system backed SPARQL store running on nodejs would be a great little project, likely to be very useful for debugging #Transmissions.   </p>
<p>So locally :</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/packages
git submodule add https://github.com/danja/sparql-store-lite.git sparql-store-lite
</code></pre>
<p>Claude <a href="https://claude.ai/chat/cb4609cc-19aa-4701-840a-c7eca3bf5d90">offered me</a> a starting point, beginning :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import rdf from &#39;rdf-ext&#39;
import N3 from &#39;n3&#39;
import { SparqlParser } from &#39;sparqljs&#39;
import { QueryEngine } from &#39;rdf-query-engine&#39;
// ...
</code></pre>
<p>@rdfjs/parser-n3</p>
<p>nvm install node</p>
<p>npm install -g npm@latest</p>
<p>npm -v</p>

<h3>webpack transmissions for in-browser</h3>
<p>To interact with GitHub&#39;s API using Node.js, here are some suitable libraries ranked by activity, coverage, and popularity:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Octokit (<a href="https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js">https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Official GitHub REST API client for JavaScript</li>
<li>Very active development, excellent coverage, and widely used</li>
<li>Supports both REST and GraphQL APIs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>@octokit/rest (<a href="https://github.com/octokit/rest.js">https://github.com/octokit/rest.js</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the Octokit ecosystem, focused on REST API</li>
<li>Active development, great coverage for REST API, popular</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>axios (<a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">https://github.com/axios/axios</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>General-purpose HTTP client, can be used with GitHub API</li>
<li>Very active, widely used, but requires more manual setup for GitHub specifics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These libraries are well-maintained, offer good coverage, and are popular in the Node.js ecosystem for GitHub API interactions.</p>
<p>Q1: What specific GitHub API features are you looking to implement in your transmissions processors?
Q2: Do you have a preference for using REST API or GraphQL API for GitHub interactions?
Q3: Are there any specific authentication methods you need to support (e.g., OAuth, Personal Access Tokens)?</p>
