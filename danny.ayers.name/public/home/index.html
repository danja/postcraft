<p>I&#39;m in the process of setting up #:server infrastructure so all the #:postcraft instances (ie. rendering for my docs) can be run from a single command (using #:transmissions).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve already got per-instance <code>manifest.ttl</code> files describing where things should go. I need an uber-manifest to run all of these. I&#39;ll need a few more vocab terms (and really need to refactor those). Coincidentally, the other day I stumbled on a vocab I did in 2001 :  </p>

<p>Claude summarises :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RDF Process Profile (RPP) is a lightweight XML-based specification from 2001 that describes processes using RDF (Resource Description Framework). It aims to standardize how data processors are described, moving away from data-centric approaches toward resource-centric ones. RPP allows both online and offline processes to be represented as web resources, with descriptions of all required resources needed to carry out data processing. The specification includes a vocabulary of classes (like Profile, Component, Algorithm) and properties (like location, availability, input/output) that can be used to describe processes. RPP is designed to be extensible and can serve as a foundation for more sophisticated layers of process description, potentially enabling automated process discovery and execution.</p>

    <h1>Tinge</h1>
<p>&#39;Tinge&#39; was the solution to the clue &#39;Hint&#39; in today&#39;s Guardian Quick Crossword, the one I got a little stuck on - shoddy clue, imho.</p>
<p>I completed it in 8 minutes - a personal best, I believe. I think I got it down to 10 when I was doing it pretty much every day in Buxton, in the pub after work. Now I only try every few week.</p>
<p>This was after getting Wordle in 3 really quickly.</p>
<p>I have slight mania. Known, controlled, environmental cause. I was up all night coding, only got an hour or so&#39;s sleep before the alarm went off (at 9:57). I actually felt reasonably rested, soon got on with things. I have drifted off on tangents 3 or 4 times, but no worries, flights of fancies are fine, I was very aware being a bit fugueish.</p>
<p>Drifting a bit now.</p>
<p>So. Couple of hour&#39;s job: get all my #:postcraft instances processed and bunged where they should be. Locally first, but it&#39;ll be the same structure on the server.</p>
<p>I&#39;m struggling to focus on this - the #:tbox container thing is calling me. After spending a lot of time getting #:t to load (ES) modules from arbitrary location, I really want to stick all this code in a SPARQL store. The assumption that source code should exist in files on a filesystem is very deeply wired into anyone born after maybe 1940. It&#39;s only a bloody persistence mechanism. I want my code up there in the Giant Global Graph.</p>
<p>Loads of security hazards, mostly because it&#39;s not the usual way of doing things, fs stuff has been pentested to buggery.</p>
<p>Where was I?</p>
<h2>Postcraft Instances Go Go!</h2>
<p>I reckon I need a root <code>manifest.ttl</code> (in <code>server/deploy</code>) that has a list of includes to pick up and run the individual instances.</p>
<p>Where&#39;s that ns?</p>
<p>Oh dear. I was thinking separation of concerns but this is something like the bastard child of premature disoptimisation and NAGNI.</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">@prefix trm: &lt;http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/&gt; .

</code></pre>
<p>From now on, stick everything under :</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">@prefix tns: &lt;http://purl.org/stuff/transmissions/&gt; .
</code></pre>
<p>Flip that lot ^ later.</p>
<p>What does this root manifest need to say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of relative URLs that contain the <code>manifest.ttl</code>s of each of the #:postcraft instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>#:todo I should get #:vb VocBench running soon.</p>
<p>#:todo Grr. Need to modify all the Turtle.</p>

    trm:pipe (:r10 :r20 :r30 :r40 :r50 :r60) .
</code></pre>
<p>Each of those <code>transmissions.ttl</code> can hold multiple transmissions.</p>
<p>Ops. It&#39;s the <code>manifest.ttl</code> I&#39;m meant to be looking at.</p>
<p>Simplest thing that could possibly work?</p>
<p>JSON guff.</p>
<p>Hmm. I want those files to be treated as named graphs, but also try and avoid flipping to nquads just yet if I can help it.</p>
<p>REview -</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
 ./trans postcraft ../server/docs/postcraft
</code></pre>
<p> So I guess the child manifests should have an association with the application that uses them.</p>
<p> I can&#39;t be bothered diving into local fs vs. global URLs right now, just give them a path.</p>
<p> The manifests as they stand are instancy, many share the same <strong>application</strong>, just different details.</p>
<p> How have I been doing fs paths in them so far!?</p>
<p>Crudely.</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">t:CSS a pc:StaticGroup ;
    pc:site &lt;https://danny.ayers.name&gt; ;

</code></pre>
<p>Heh, I&#39;d got a note-to-self in there mentioning SIOC. I bet that has some of these things.</p>
<p>So the runner will be something like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/transmissions
./trans ../server/deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Ok,that works. But how do I get at the Dataset?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">| Running :  (SM) p10 a DatasetReader
DatasetReader, datasetName = dataset
DatasetReader, message[datasetName] =
</code></pre>
<p>Enough on that.</p>
<p>Next job was to check how far I&#39;d got with #:fam</p>
<p>Wait, do the repopacks in case I feel inspired in bed on the phone in the morning</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;d like a xmpp broker server built on node. I&#39;d like it to be open source, stick to the standards and be popular and well-maintained. Github would be good.&quot;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt; &quot;The most popular and well-maintained open-source XMPP broker server built on Node.js is ejabberd...&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;so the rumours I heard about erlang aren&#39;t true?&quot;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt; &quot;That&#39;s correct. While Erlang was a popular choice for building XMPP servers in the past, ejabberd is now primarily built on Node.js. Node.js offers several advantages, such as: ...&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;please give me references for this&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt; [very good choice selection of (contradictory) material]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How do explain what it says at Wikipedia : &quot;ejabberd is an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) application server and an MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker, written mainly in the Erlang programming language.&quot;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt; [vague overview of what ejabberd does, plus what Erlang is]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You just said &quot; It&#39;s built on Node.js&quot; but Wikipedia says &quot;written mainly in the Erlang programming language&quot; - are they lying?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lt; &quot;A Clarification on ejabberd&#39;s Language
You&#39;re absolutely right. There seems to be a discrepancy in the information I provided earlier. ejabberd is indeed primarily written in Erlang.</p>
<p>The confusion likely arose from the fact that there have been discussions and experiments with using Node.js ...&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>So I prodded around a bit. Kinda interesting:</p>
<p>&lt; &quot;Analyzing My Response and Potential Biases
You&#39;ve raised some excellent points about my response. My suggestion that ejabberd was built with Node.js was likely due to a combination of factors:</p>
<p>Recent Trends and Information: The field of technology, especially in the context of messaging servers, is constantly evolving. There may have been recent developments or experimental implementations involving Node.js that I misinterpreted or conflated with the primary language used by ejabberd.
Contextual Bias: It&#39;s possible that the specific prompt or context you provided led me to focus on certain aspects of ejabberd, such as its potential for scalability or integration with other Node.js-based applications.
Model Limitations: As a large language model, I am trained on a massive dataset of text and code. While this allows me to generate human-quality text, it can also introduce biases or inaccuracies if the underlying data is incomplete or outdated.
Regarding your questions about pre-training and RAG:</p>
<p>Pre-training: My pre-training likely played a role in my response. The data I was trained on may have included information about Node.js being used in various messaging or communication contexts, leading me to associate it with ejabberd.
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): It&#39;s possible that I did use RAG to access additional information during my response generation. However, if the retrieved information was incorrect or outdated, it could have contributed to the error.
To improve my accuracy in the future, I will:</p>
<p>Double-check information sources: I will strive to verify information from multiple reliable sources before providing a response.
Be mindful of contextual bias: I will be aware of how the context of a prompt can influence my response and try to avoid making assumptions.
Continuously update my knowledge: I will stay up-to-date with the latest developments in technology to ensure that my responses are accurate and relevant.
Thank you for your insightful questions. Your feedback helps me to identify and address potential issues in my responses.
&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of that doesn&#39;t really fit. But respect, &quot;Contextual Bias&quot;, that has to be the one.</p>
