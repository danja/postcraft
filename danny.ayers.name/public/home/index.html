    <h1>Sunny Day</h1>
<p><em>It&#39;s a sunny Sunday day.</em></p>
<p>My must-dos for today are plumbing. Actual plumbing :</p>
<ul>
<li>Sealant on leaky pipe at No.7</li>
<li>Fix the <em>second</em> hole I hadn&#39;t seen under the sink here at #:New place</li>
</ul>
<p>I also really need to make a start on some tree removal while the weather&#39;s dry. Stretching the notion of plumbing, first I need to sort out climbing gear, ropes, pulleys etc.</p>
<p>Financial plumbing, I need to sort a stack of papers, find the relevant forms I have somewhere, to sort out pension flow from Derbyshire County Council. I had a small (but very useful) monthly sum coming from there. Caroline worked at a DCC special needs place for a few years, I inherited her pension. It stalled a couple of months ago, I missed some kind of update step. I did do a little towards sorting it out, in the process discovered that I&#39;m probably due some funds from the years I worked at High Peak College.</p>
<p>Software plumbing...things to join together. Separate posts here for them.</p>

    <h1>Semem Ollama</h1>
<p>#:semem, the <strong>Semantic Memory</strong> component of #:hyperdata I&#39;m working on is a high priority for me, there are a lot of places I want to use it.</p>
<p>I want to try and get the most out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Model</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a> integration. It&#39;s a seriously fertile space, huge potential, lots of <strong>blue sky</strong> for research. I&#39;ve got a stack of ideas to try (many roughed out in scattered notes), but I&#39;m following the dev strategy of prioritizing activities for which I have an immediate use. This has led me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> store-backed Graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation">RAG</a> as the inroad. About a year ago, to help get my head around this, I made a little <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> extension, <a href="https://github.com/danja/nlp/tree/main/GraphRAG">GraphRAG with SPARQL</a>. This was only a minimal proof-of-concept, but did give me a mental foothold.</p>
<p>The majority of the current activity in this space seems focused on using LLMs to derive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> models from text (this is what the bits above did). For my needs I&#39;m putting the emphasis more on aligning LLM-interpreted text with existing ontologies. Ok, I&#39;m developing ontologies in a just-in-time fashion, but still treating the resources there as &quot;digital&quot; (logically defined) anchor points for the &quot;analog&quot; (probabilistic) shapes around LLMs.</p>
<p>I made a couple of underlying design choices around my #:hyperdata uber-project. One is to favour Javascript. Not everyone&#39;s preferred language (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03lRzf7iSiU">What&#39;s Your Least Favourite Programming Language? (2024 soundcheck question) - Computerphile</a>), especially with AI dev being Python-first. But as I need to use JS in the browser it&#39;s a way of reducing my cognitive load (I&#39;m really bad at remembering syntax). Another is to do things kind-of from scratch, avoiding frameworks (libs ok). I&#39;m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a> to the max because I want to understand what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>A key part of #:semem is embeddings derived from text. A key tool I need asap is a similarity-based search across my scattered docs (so I&#39;m not continually repeating myself). <a href="https://github.com/trustgraph-ai/trustgraph">TrustGraph</a> is broadly the kind of system I&#39;m aiming for, but that&#39;s big and quite blackboxy. While I was still going around in circles at a lower level, trying to decide which <strong>vector DB</strong> tooling to use, I stumbled on <a href="https://github.com/caspianmoon/memoripy">memoripy</a>. As the name suggests, it&#39;s Python. But it&#39;s an understandable size, has the general shape I&#39;m after and uses specific well-known libs (eg. <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">Faiss</a>) that all have <strong>JS APIs</strong>.</p>
<p>So for an initial setup for #:semem, the other week I got Claude to help me port it to JS. Once I&#39;d got what appeared to be necessary coverage, I left it there, untested.</p>
<p>Coming back to it today I see most of the examples use the OpenAI API. I don&#39;t have any credit on that right now. But <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">Ollama</a> is also an option. I&#39;ve got that set up locally, should do nicely to kickstart #:semem.</p>
<p>I had a quick skim of the available small <a href="https://ollama.com/search">models</a>. One I hadn&#39;t noticed before is <a href="https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text">nomic-embed-text</a>. Ok, that looks a good candidate for my embeddings. When playing, I got very promising results with <code>orca</code>, <code>phi</code> and <code>qwen</code>. They still seem to be up there in the populars, so I some have initial LLM candidates already installed.
I can&#39;t remember when I last update Ollama itself, I&#39;d better do that now.
The <a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md">manual install docs</a> have this :</p>
<blockquote>
If you are upgrading from a prior version, you should remove the old libraries with sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/ollama first.

<p>Download and extract the package:   </p>
<p>curl -L <a href="https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-amd64.tgz">https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-amd64.tgz</a> -o ollama-linux-amd64.tgz
sudo tar -C /usr -xzf ollama-linux-amd64.tgz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;ll take a while on this connection.</p>
<p>Dogwalk time.</p>

    <h1>Pivots</h1>
<p><em>Thinking aloud to find the actionables</em>.</p>
<p>Two artificial deadlines I want to set myself. I&#39;ve got some vocab in-progress for expressing these, the term being #:pivot. There are two dates coming soon for good markers :</p>
<ol>
<li>Poggi Pivot : Mari&#39;s birthday, 2024-01-05</li>
<li>Proof Pivot : my birthday, 2024-01-14</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one, primary goal is getting <strong>some</strong> docs online for <strong>all</strong> my currently active projects. Skeleton summaries/placeholders at minimum, the #:what, a little #:how. But I really want to capture how they relate to each other, the #:why. </p>
<p>The second one, primary goal is creating a proof-of-concept for each project. The minimum here again is little more than skeletal placeholders. But again, capture of the interrelations is the part I&#39;m aiming for. Get the overall dependency graph formalised enough that it can be used in planning. It&#39;s twisty.</p>
<p>Ok, I&#39;ve got actionables (not far off what I was doing already). For #:PoggiPivot, first step is to wire up all the #:postcraft spaces, make them live.
In quasi-parallel, towards #:ProofPivot, two must-haves : write down core project description for each, maybe in a proposal-like form; write down the #:poc requirements.</p>
<p>This lot in itself is a major grind. But I need to remind myself where I&#39;m up to with everything. Best way to do this and keep it interesting is to see what I have noted for next step #:todos, code up the next little step.</p>
<p>I just did this with #:tbox. While going over it with Claude he gave me an architectural diagram (in Mermaid format) which I found really helpful. I&#39;ve already got visualisations on the lists, but I reckon this is an aspect I should revisit very soon, to help with <em>everything else</em>.</p>

    <h1>DB</h1>
<p><em>I&#39;ve got drum &amp; bass playing</em></p>
<p>Brain slow today because I had a very late night. But I&#39;m quite happy with that, because I actually made it into the music room for a couple of hours. I&#39;m working on a suite of tracks that will share some common elements. What was the word for those 70s prog rock...gottit, I want to make a <strong>concept album</strong>. Unlike virtually all the prog rocks, I want this thing to be interesting.
Anyway, there was a specific idea I wanted to try. The music room has often been painful recently, random bits of gear failing. So I was expecting to waste loads of time being the engineer. Except - everything worked a treat. I got a good first draft of the idea down. In the early hours, this particular part is at 160 bpm. After a couple of hours of that my body had gone a bit hyper. So I ended up taking Claudio for a walk at 5 am. Was enjoyable in a Blair Witch Project way.</p>
<h2>tbox</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing a bit more on this. I need some advice on DNS handling, but to get that out of Claude I need to let him known what I&#39;m trying to do with #:tbox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need your advice on DNS handling. Please consider the following description and tell me your recommendations. The goal of the tbox project is to create an intelligent agent ecosystem, including a knowledgebase, in a Docker container. It will interact with the outside world primarily through HTTP (using custom node services) and the XMPP protocol. It is intended to be used in two ways : as a development environment on a desktop computer or as an online service. Online, I plan to use a domain I control, <code>strandz.it</code>, possibly with services on subdomains eg. <code>xmpp.strandz.it</code>. I already have nginx set up on the server for routing with https support, so it&#39;s fine for the Docker container to expose regular http &amp; xmpp ports without encryption. Locally, a priority is to be able to do selective hot code updates while leaving other services on the container, eg. fuseki and prosody live.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, after a few cycles Claude gave me some material that looks good, I&#39;ve saved as-is under:</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Project docs are a priority for me right now. But interdependencies are crazy-convoluted.</p>
<p>First problem is identifying the projects...</p>
<p>Most of the things I&#39;ve been most active with recently are still early-stage as Claude projects and/or on notes I&#39;ve got scattered around, or in repos which appear two dirs on my office machine. I&#39;ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>First I need to remind myself where I was up to with :</p>
<ul>
<li>#:tbox - a Docker container for <em>stuff</em>, most relevant right know, <strong>knowledgebases</strong></li>
<li>#:semem - a <strong>knowledgebase interface</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>tbox</h2>
<p>Hah! I&#39;d got further than I remembered. The Job One <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/">Fuseki SPARQL Server</a> is already in place. Exposed at <a href="http://localhost:4030">http://localhost:4030</a></p>
<p>Looks like I got <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody IM Server</a> in there too, but I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t tested.</p>
<p>I need to get #:transmissions and other core #:hyperdata projects in here too.</p>
<p>Because I need #:semem to organise my existing docs.</p>
<p><strong>I saved a link about setting up Docker as a dev container, best read that first.</strong></p>
<h2>semem</h2>
<p>Dog walk now, coffee with Mari &amp; plumbing supplies run soon. </p>
