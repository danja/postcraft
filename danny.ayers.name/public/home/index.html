    <h1>Solstice</h1>
<p><em>It&#39;s the shortest day!</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m ambivalent about Christmas, don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever partaken of any of the other rituals of the season. But I sure do celebrate the <strong>winter solstice</strong>, in spirit if not in much action (I plan to get a few <strong>beers</strong> later). I can explain best by quoting a late friend of mine :    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nights are drawing in.&quot;
- Geoff Beswick of Priestcliffe (every year soon after 21st June)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a> in the clinical sense. But I&#39;m a late riser, short days (with the associated unpleasant weather) really do impact my mood, however indirectly. So here, I&#39;ll claim the quote :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nights are drawing out!&quot;</p>

<h2>More Postcraft</h2>
<p>Grrr. Returning to the #:postcraft bits from yesterday, I just discovered a bug that&#39;s crept into #:transmissions. I wanted to check how the paths are allocated, so went to isolate that particular operation. But...</p>
<p>The command :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./trans postcraft.copy ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
</code></pre>
<p>should only run the subsection of the application <code>postcraft</code> called <code>copy</code>. This is a single #:transmission (= pipeline) in  <a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/transmissions.ttl">transmissions.ttl</a>. I did put the wiring in place for this, but <strong>fool Danny</strong> once again didn&#39;t get around to giving it a corresponding <strong>test</strong>. Or did I..?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm run test
</code></pre>
<p>-bombs straight out with an error during a test on the <code>FilenameMapper</code> processor (still no idea if there&#39;s a test for the <code>transmissions.sub</code> selector).</p>
<p>Hah! <strong>Fool Danny</strong> once again forgot to run <strong>tests</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Bloody hell</em>, all I wanted to do with this when I got to desk yesterday was to fix a trivial CSS bug.</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;d best just put a bandaid on the CSS for now, then check the tests. I&#39;ve been meaning to set up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD">CI/CD</a> bits on GitHub for a while... (I really want such things embedded in #:transmissions itself, so it can notify of any problems preemptively, declare it&#39;s own status - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing">Shift-Left</a> to the max).</p>
<p>Heh ho. I&#39;ll have to leave that for now, got some jobs to do that require <strong>daylight</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Layout</h1>
<p>With Claude&#39;s help (I gave the <code>index.html</code> + CSS files as attachments), I&#39;ve fixed the immediate layout bug I had here. My system prompt (which I&#39;ll post in a mo) asks Claude for suggestions, and after this it suggested :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>q4: Should we implement a sticky header or navigation elements?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sticky menu button was already in my todos, so I went <code>q4</code>. Claude gave me a bunch of code using React.  To which I responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be vanilla JS, please revise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I have a sticky button! I&#39;ll populate it later, daylight activities to do.</p>
<p>When I tried it on my phone it still wasn&#39;t quite right, but clearing the cache sorted it out. So I&#39;ve added this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- #:todo remove when stable --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; content=&quot;no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The stuff here is all lightweight, so that may stay a while.</p>
<p>All good!</p>

<h2>Aside</h2>
<p>I noted this elsewhere the other night, this afternoon one of the clickbaity things told me OpenAI had achieved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">AGI</a>. Because it did better than another benchmark. Pardon my French again, <del>two</del> three &quot;fuck&quot;s in a single post. <strong>Fucking shite</strong> (1.5 cent in the sweary token box?). Anyway, I do have a lot to say about this, will be tagged #:linguefranche - nah, #:l. It&#39;s very important IMO, a one-l ref here.</p>
<p>Only a few times have I seen myself quoted, and I cannot express the magnitude of buzz I got. Like <em>danja says...</em>. Maybe Freudian parent thing, maybe just screaming into the void forever...
So :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If even a small LM can make a good prediction of a stream of text, might it be the case that rather than the LM being intelligent, the text is stupid?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruAi4VBoBSM">stars/gutter</a></em></p>
<p>This is a point at which I believe work is needed (<em>doing my best</em>). The material chatty GPTs are trained on, text, is a lowered-dimension expression of a sliver of the multimodal communication between a particular kind of animals. Yeah, for animal evolution, it enables transcendence. But it&#39;s still a really shitty (sweary token!) serial protocol that evolved when us hominid critters tried co-existing. For it to be useful, it needs a agent either end to have a really fucking (0.05c sweary tokens now) good model of the universe. Mountains of abstraction (John Sowa says ontology is necessary, I&#39;d go further). Not just either end, but societies of extremely multimodal co-evolving agents. Ok, it&#39;s quite miraculous I can string a sentence together these days given the booze I&#39;ve got through. But I can&#39;t express myself in English, or pour myself a glass of beer through some kind of monolithic intelligence I carry. The very millisecond I thought of that, I have this screen in front of me, I also heard a little crack from the fire downstairs. Claudio will be dozing on the couch in front of it, but that would be below the threshold to make him jump. I&#39;m aware of this other autonomous agent in my proximity. I&#39;m aware of several other active agents that are active, in the sense I can make an internal model of what they are doing right now.</p>
<p>More, the models we carry - initially evolved not far from a GPT model, pre-trained for reactivity (in a very complex environment), are incredibly plastic. Our language in the texty sense, psychological, technical senses is sooooo crude for mapping reality. The internals only work because of the ability to maintain a form of just-enough pattern-match for this moment. Statement on this : I don&#39;t see any reason why AI can&#39;t surpass what we call human intelligence in the near future. But the current state of the art is really, really, really, really shit (3.0c? or should that be 4x?) compared to the stuff I saw in the rat that came out of the dogfood bag on the balcony earlier.  </p>
<p><em>Does Artificial General Intelligence cover other physics than our own, and any comcommitant perceived realities? If not why not..?</em>          </p>
<p>The biggest stupidity in all this is easy to qualify. Human exceptionalism. For fuck&#39;s sake, my fucking dog (oops, &gt;= 5 sweary tokens) recently learnt how to squeeze my hand. A while back a friend introduced him to <code>zampa</code> (paw) as a means of getting a treat. Soon after he figured out how to use it as a means of expression (his speech &amp; typing skills are limited). Because he showed me by example, <strong>the dog taught me</strong> the signs, I know the difference between about maybe 6 different things that are directly actionable things he wants me to do. But the zampa is a broad word meaning attention please. Lying on the couch in front of the fire, both of us dozing, he&#39;ll gentle-zampa in a way I understand to mean acknowledging my presence. It seemed very sweet, so I hold his zampa, and give it a little squeeze, anthropomorphicaly. Except <strong>fuck anthropomorphism</strong> (6). Those encounters now, he does a gentle zampa, I hold his paw, he pulls in his toes and (to the best of his ability) gives my hand a squeeze. No direct training involved. He&#39;s motivated to communicate with me (best friends - food too, but Danny isn&#39;t just a feedy machine, Claudio isn&#39;t just an eaty machine), so he find ways of doing so. That I&#39;d call a decent goal for the computational systems, not some wanky contrived text recognition benchmark (0.01? I&#39;ve forgotten my sweary weights here, cunt (+1)).     </p>
<p>Fuck me (+1). Good cue. Claudio just came up to tell me the fire&#39;s gone out.</p>

    <h1>Claude System Prompt</h1>
<p>The prompt I use with Claude projects is continually changing, and being tweaked per-project. Below is the one I&#39;ve currently got for #:transmissions, I think it&#39;s the most recent. Size-wise, when used with a heap of Project knowledge the context window does get a bit stretched. The <strong>handover</strong> document is useful. After a few cycles in a chat session, some little job done, I use it to give a bit of recent memory to the next session. The RDF rendition I&#39;m recording to give to #:farelo (project management) later. (I&#39;ll be glad when I&#39;ve got all this automated. <em>Work in progress...</em>).</p>
<p>The q1, q2... part is really good. Very often one suggestion is exactly what I want next, so it saves typing. Quite often there are suggestions that are good ideas I hadn&#39;t thought of. Good machine-human colab, innit.</p>
<p>I frequently do an export from Claude. I&#39;ve got a #:transmissions application <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/claude-json-converter">claude-json-converter</a> to split the big JSON file into smaller dirs of markdown files. It&#39;s rough &amp; ready, but good enough to enable me to usefully search the stuff (and should be usable with RAG later).</p>
<p>Time for a solstice beer.</p>

    <h1>Postcraft</h1>
<p>#:postcraft is an application of #:transmissions which I put while figuring out #:transmissions. It&#39;s a static site builder, you&#39;re looking at its product. Right now it&#39;s <strong>a crufty, fragile, seriously over-engineered and breathtakingly inefficient static site builder</strong>. But that&#39;s not a problem. Things <em>should</em> be coupled loosely enough that I can incrementally improve all this with minimal breakage along the way. <em>Should</em> be.</p>
<p>The fact that I&#39;ve messed up the CSS somewhere but have no idea where suggests there <em>is</em> a problem.</p>
<p>I&#39;m only using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS for presentation, but it&#39;s all a bit of a lump right now. I need to tease out the bits that are actually in use, relocate and organise them in a way that I can work on them in isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Ew.</strong> The current filesystem setup really is a shambles.</p>
<p>Ok, the root of this site when published locally is :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/public/home
...
ls
css  entries  fonts  index.html  js  media  static
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>index.html</code> is :</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/fonts.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/grid-columns.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm. I put the <code>danny.ayers.name</code> material under <code>.../postcraft/</code> because it&#39;s been acting as test data. This might be a good time to move it somewhere more production-like. Ok, new repo : <a href="https://github.com/danja/danny.ayers.name">https://github.com/danja/danny.ayers.name</a></p>
<p>As a static site builder #:postcraft currently :</p>
<ul>
<li>copies a bunch of stuff from A -&gt; B</li>
<li>walks dirs transforming markdown -&gt; html</li>
<li>templates the individual entry pages</li>
<li>templates <code>index.html</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d better remind myself of the #:postcraft #:transmission and the manifest I&#39;m using for <code>danny.ayers.name</code>. Might as well make copies for future ref. It seems I&#39;m using <a href="https://danny.ayers.name/static/">https://danny.ayers.name/static/</a> as the base for material that should be published verbatim. The word <code>static</code> isn&#39;t quite right, but I guess it fits ok with not-quite-right conventions.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a bit of chicken &amp; egg here, the documentation for #:transmissions will be published using #:transmissions. Short version :</p>
<ul>
<li>A #:transmissions <strong>application</strong> is defined by its -<ul>
<li><strong>transmissions</strong>, the topology of the processing pipelines</li>
<li><strong>configuration</strong>, the settings for the nodes in the pipelines, which are <strong>processors</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The #:postcraft application has :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/transmissions.ttl">transmissions.ttl</a></li>
<li><a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/config.ttl">config.ttl</a></li>
<li><a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/about.md">about.md</a> - the applications should mostly be self-documenting in the Turtle files (together with the processor signatures), but I&#39;ve included these for out-of-band info, notes-to-self. I&#39;ll probably add an <code>about.ttl</code> later, hints for the machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a #:transmissions application is invoked, a <strong>target</strong> may be provided for instance-specific data. In this case, there&#39;s a <code>manifest.ttl</code> on the filesystem with the necessary for building the <code>danny.ayers.name</code> site.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/manifest.ttl">manifest.ttl</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve a <em>huge</em> amount of refactoring &amp; tweaking to do around #:transmissions. Here the separation of concerns between config &amp; manifest isn&#39;t very clean, vocab clunky. But I&#39;m happy to call this fundamental structure done for now. There are a bunch of new features I plan to implement in the near future. But I&#39;ve got to be careful about <strong>priorities</strong> (this is what I need #:farelo, kind-of project management tooling, also in-progress).  </p>
<p>Dogwalk...
...where was I?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, sources &amp; destinations of things. First, I want another set of copies of those files. I should be more systematic and use for-purpose version control better. Showing my age here, I predate VCS. But simply making a copy of the application dir and calling it <code>postcraft-previous</code> works pragmatically.</p>
<p><code>trans</code> is simply symlinked to a <code>run.js</code>, partial prep for something I dare put on the <code>$PATH</code>. <code>postcraft</code> the <strong>application</strong> here appears in #:transmissions&#39; source tree (it doesn&#39;t have to, I&#39;m following a strategy of minimising ties to the filesystem as I go along, but there&#39;s no rush to move it). The <strong>target</strong> is given as a relative path, where to look for a <code>manifest.ttl</code>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve slipped into my own little convention for locating repos on these Ubuntu machines :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"> /home/danny/github-danny
 /home/danny/github-other
</code></pre>
<p>So most of the time when I&#39;m coding I use <code>~/github-danny</code> as a temporary home.</p>
<p>Now how am I expressing the paths in <a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/config.ttl">config.ttl</a>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">t:copyStatic a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:key t:staticCopy ;
    trm:source &quot;content-static&quot; ;
    trm:destination &quot;public/home/static&quot; .
</code></pre>
<p>And where does that wind up using when it&#39;s run?</p>
<p>Ok, I need that <code>about.md</code> note-to-self, give it a little tweak :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/github-danny/transmissions

./trans postcraft ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name | grep content-static
</code></pre>
<p>Ah. On my to-do list is swapping the hacky logger that&#39;s in #:transmissions now for a proper one, and have the thing support a <code>--verbose</code> flag. Not a biggy, I can force the log level to debug inside whichever <strong>processor</strong> is doing the copy.
Ok, here it is in</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">### static dirs
:cp10 a :FileCopy ;
    trm:configKey :staticCopy .
</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ve only just added support for <strong>processors</strong> (implemented as ES modules) outside of the #:transmissions source tree, so this&#39;ll be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">src/processors/fs/FileCopy.js
</code></pre>
<p>Pop in <code> logger.setLogLevel(&quot;debug&quot;)</code>, rerun the application+grep,</p>
<pre><code>Copying directory from /home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/content-static to /home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/public/home/static
</code></pre>
<p><em>It said that twice. Odd, but not a worry for today.</em></p>
<p>Grr. Some jobs I need to do before it goes dark.
I&#39;ll just check what happens when I tweak the path :</p>
<pre><code class="language-turtle">t:copyStatic a trm:ServiceConfig ;
    trm:key t:staticCopy ;
    trm:source &quot;content-static&quot; ;
    trm:destination &quot;../../danny.ayers.name/static&quot; .
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./trans postcraft ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name | grep content-static

...
Copying directory: /home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/content-static to /home/danny/github-danny/danny.ayers.name/static
</code></pre>
<p>Good-o, just as I&#39;d hoped.</p>
<p>So now I&#39;ll just flip the path back, type <code>p</code> on my local machine - a script which will run the above, then push the result up to the server.
Next I <code>ssh</code> into the server, another little script :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd /home/github-danny
./pull-all.sh
</code></pre>
<p>And this here should be live.</p>
<p>Break time. </p>
