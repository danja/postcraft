    <h1>Postcraft</h1>
<p>#:postcraft is an application of #:transmissions which I put while figuring out #:transmissions. It&#39;s a static site builder, you&#39;re looking at its product. Right now it&#39;s <strong>a crufty, fragile, seriously over-engineered and breathtakingly inefficient static site builder</strong>. But that&#39;s not a problem. Things <em>should</em> be coupled loosely enough that I can incrementally improve all this with minimal breakage along the way. <em>Should</em> be.</p>
<p>The fact that I&#39;ve messed up the CSS somewhere but have no idea where suggests there <em>is</em> a problem.</p>
<p>I&#39;m only using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS for presentation, but it&#39;s all a bit of a lump right now. I need to tease out the bits that are actually in use, relocate and organise them in a way that I can work on them in isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Ew.</strong> The current filesystem setup really is a shambles.</p>
<p>Ok, the root of this site when published locally is :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">/home/danny/github-danny/postcraft/danny.ayers.name/public/home
...
ls
css  entries  fonts  index.html  js  media  static
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>index.html</code> is :</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/fonts.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/grid-columns.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm. I put the <code>danny.ayers.name</code> material under <code>.../postcraft/</code> because it&#39;s been acting as test data. This might be a good time to move it somewhere more production-like. Ok, new repo : <a href="https://github.com/danja/danny.ayers.name">https://github.com/danja/danny.ayers.name</a></p>
<p>As a static site builder #:postcraft currently :</p>
<ul>
<li>copies a bunch of stuff from A -&gt; B</li>
<li>walks dirs transforming markdown -&gt; html</li>
<li>templates the individual entry pages</li>
<li>templates <code>index.html</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d better remind myself of the #:postcraft #:transmission and the manifest I&#39;m using for <code>danny.ayers.name</code>.</p>

    <h1>Stream</h1>
<p>I&#39;ll push this out now, pre-pre-draft. Note blog title (#:todo italicize - &quot;Raw<em>er</em>&quot;). Taking me ages to get things down, break for more immediate dopamine-shot generating activities for a while... </p>
<p><em>On the BBC Radio 4 news this morning it mentioned that UK water bills were going to be significantly increased. This is despite the recipient companies having displayed an egregious lack of concern over water supplies to consumers and appalling disregard for the environment. The following stream of consciousness is lumpy like British rivers.</em></p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot I need to write up. There&#39;s also a lot of <strong>stuff</strong> I need to do. The two are deeply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity">intertwingled</a>. The latter is much better at holding my attention, the former I can keep in my head until I get around to it. But I just had a trip to the UK, family-related, that totally disrupted my mental waterways. Time for an <strong>unstructured dump</strong>.</p>
<p>In chat this morning with #:ClaudioB, he mentioned the <a href="http://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>. I&#39;d just started looking at this before I got called away, but not before <del>I&#39;d</del> we&#39;d (#:ClaudeAI &amp; I) done a first pass at an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> mapping : <a href="https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/mcp/">Model Context Protocol Ontology</a>. This is very relevant to something I&#39;ve been working on, #:LingueFranche, see below.</p>
<h2>KIA Intelligence Agency</h2>
<p><strong>A heterogenous community of autonomous agents.</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#39;t really a thing yet. But it&#39;s where I&#39;m heading with <em>all the other things</em> (jeez, there is a lot I need to write up).</p>
<p>For convenience, near future, a testbed/playground using <a href="https://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_computer-mediated_communication">MUC</a>. I did have ejabberd running on my server before, but I&#39;m now in the process of setting up <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody</a> in a Docker container, in which other stuff will live. Docker for repeatability, Prosody because it has a bit less baggage.</p>
<h3>Semantic Hashtags</h3>
<p>I should explain the #:SemanticHashtag syntax, which also relates to #:LingueFranche. I can&#39;t remember whether or not I got as far as spec&#39;ing this out yet, but it&#39;s an easy one in principle. Just a small extension of the familiar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomic</a> <strong>#hashtag</strong>. Rather that it having global scope (as on Twitter etc), it&#39;s localised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A context (in this case the domain <a href="https://hyperdata.it">https://hyperdata.it</a>) <em>MAY</em> assert it&#39;s in use (eg. via a HTML <code>meta</code> tag). In which case further disambiguation <em>SHOULD</em> be made available in that context. This <em>MAY</em> be expressed using a dereferenceable IRI, linked from the #:tag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, I&#39;m including them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> I write. At some point I&#39;ll put a #:processor in the rendering pipeline to link them to <em>something useful</em>. At minimum, a list of the pages here in which the term is used. It&#39;s something that can be <strong>progressively enhanced</strong>.</p>
<h2>My Infrastructure</h2>
<p>#:ClaudioB also asked earlier about what I do for hosting. Currently I use s/<a href="https://www.linode.com">linode</a>/Akamai. I have maybe their cheapest Linux virtual host (physically in London Docklands somewhere), 2GB RAM, some kind of minimal CPU cover. From here it looks like bare metal, I run Ubuntu on that. On top, main thing is <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a> for static Web, proxying to other local services as appropriate. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> for certs. I do most things via ssh in a terminal. The bandwidth is great, performance adequate for much (<code>cough</code>) <em>regular</em> stuff. When I started using them a few years back they were about the cheapest that seemed to get good reviews for such a setup.</p>
<p>On home LAN I&#39;ve got a couple of desktops and a laptop, a couple of oddities I&#39;m in the process of resurrecting and an Android phone (with <a href="https://termux.dev/en/">Termux</a>, which is awesome). Oh yeah, and my mother&#39;s (very) old iPhone, which I&#39;ve yet to play with. First one I&#39;ve owned (I did have a little Apple laptop for a while, years ago, but $s and familiarity mean I&#39;m all-Ubuntu now). Oh yeah, I&#39;ve also a handful of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32">ESP32</a> microcontroller-based things I&#39;ve made that are WiFi/HTTP-aware, when switched on and behaving themselves.</p>

    <h1>SigMod</h1>
<p><em>Not that <a href="https://sigmod.org/">SIGMOD</a></em></p>
<p>Mari gave me a lift into town earlier for a Dr&#39;s appt. We arrived early so waited in the car for a while. Phones out.</p>
<p>Among the more recent of the 1987 Chrome tabs I had open <sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> was <a href="https://dspy.ai/">DSPy</a>. It&#39;d buzzed my radar on some previous occasion, when I only did the most cursory of skims. Today it reappeared from a different direction so I had a better look. A line in the page made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Phil Karlton (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">Martin Fowler</a> has backstory &amp; variants)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve struggled a lot with naming in my #:transmissions pipeliney-thing <em>sub</em>project. The fine line between getting the correct term <em>semantically</em> but without using a term that is so heavily overloaded as to confuse. A good example was <strong>Service</strong>, which I started with for a particular kind of unit of code. It worked ok for these fairly independent little <strong>node</strong>js chunks that act as processing <strong>node</strong>s in the <del>s/pipeline/graph</del> <strong>Transmission</strong>. But although these things might be implemented as eg. microservices, that term brought the potential implication that some remote-calling protocol (like HTTP) <em>had</em> to be involved (they are identified with URIs, another layer of misdirection). Going in the other direction, <strong>Function</strong> was another candidate. The shape is <code>y = f(x)</code>. But that&#39;s rather a no-no in a language where it&#39;s already a reserved word, not to mention that most won&#39;t be pure functions, hell to pay from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Church</a>.</p>
<p>These things appear in the current and only implementation of #:transmissions as a single function wrapped in a class inside an EcmaScript <strong>module</strong>. But they have a single object as input, a single transformed object as output (not really, but ok as first approx, the rest is tangential). Their purpose (first approx) is to process a message. Name I settled on <strong>Process</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on #:transmissions for about a year now. The initial motivation was that I had a variety of things to build, they all shared (at a suitable level of abstraction) the same pipeliney structure. I roughed something out, first just for a static site generator. In the <em>process</em> bringing LLMs into my workflow, serendipity kicked in. It turned out to be fairly optimal for what you can get in an LLM&#39;s <strong>context window</strong>. The <strong>Transmission</strong> at the planning level, and individual <strong>Process</strong>es are all at a level of complexity that the LLM can handle comfortably. It&#39;s also humanly-checkable, programming best practices, testable etc. The structural, nuts &amp; bolts bits of #:transmissions do go beyond. I have actually had to think about things myself there (boo!). Still not nailed down enough to proclaim a v1.0.0, still loads in flux.</p>
<p>Going back to the naming. So a <strong>Process</strong> has an <strong>input</strong> (message) and <strong>output</strong> (message) as well as internal <strong>behaviour</strong>. To be able to collaborate with the LLM on these things (and for any future use) there needs to be some #:LingueFranche to describe these things. A quasi-formal language, perhaps. I started with a comment block in the code (so it&#39;d work with JSDoc), since going much more RDF (because WWW). I&#39;ve still not got the details ironed out, but early on I settled on a name for these descriptions of process <strong>module</strong>s, things in a space not quite <strong>Contract</strong>s, but different from OO/service <strong>Interface</strong>s : <strong>Signature</strong>.  </p>
<p>Imagine my delight on finding this line in the <a href="https://dspy.ai/">DSPy</a> docs :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every AI component in your system, you specify input/output behavior as a signature and select a module to assign a strategy for invoking your LM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I laughed out loud. The context is only slightly different (major overlaps), but I love that I, and the folks behind this had converged on pretty much the same vocab.</p>

    <h1>Matches</h1>
<p>I had a very distracting trip to the UK, and now I&#39;m trying to pick up from where I left off with code projects. I started yesterday, but my brain wasn&#39;t yet in gear, so went for something near the top of my to-dos, Install Aider Composer #:link. Did that, called it a day.</p>
<p>This morning when I got to desk the machine was playing silly buggers, so I had to start with an hour of tedious sysadmin.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, got to my code proper. Apparently I&#39;d made a good start on #:squirt, essentially (for now) a simple bit of HTML form-based UI for posting stuff to a SPARQL server. I&#39;d been working with Claude Projects, starting with quite a lengthy requirements spec and a bunch of relevant knowledge files.</p>
<p>I ran the latest <code>npm build dev</code>, which is hooked into webpack #:link for bundling. I&#39;m using vanilla JS but a key dependency is the RDF-Ext lib #:link. When opening what should have been a form, I got an error : <code>dataset.removeMatches()</code>. I&#39;ve not got my workflow for Aider Composer figured out yet, and couldn&#39;t be bothered doing another cycle with Claude just yet. Plan C : <strong>view source</strong>. Took 2 mins to find that it should have been <code>dataset.deleteMatches()</code>. Claude may have been drawing on an old version of the RDF-Ext material, but I had given it a bunch of current code in the Project knowledge, so maybe it just got mixed up/hallucinated.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s me reminded re. #:squirt. While away, the state of my current online material went under the headlights a couple of times, so that&#39;s been pushed up priorities. Make <strong>this</strong> look nice!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also got loads of fairly urgent real world stuff to do this week, like taking down a couple of trees. Sunny today, so I&#39;d better make a start on that.</p>
<p>Dogwalk first.  </p>
