    <h1>Sunny Day</h1>
<p><em>It&#39;s a sunny Sunday day.</em></p>
<p>My must-dos for today are plumbing. Actual plumbing :</p>
<ul>
<li>Sealant on leaky pipe at No.7</li>
<li>Fix the <em>second</em> hole I hadn&#39;t seen under the sink here at #:New place</li>
</ul>
<p>I also really need to make a start on some tree removal while the weather&#39;s dry. Stretching the notion of plumbing, first I need to sort out climbing gear, ropes, pulleys etc.</p>
<p>Financial plumbing, I need to sort a stack of papers, find the relevant forms I have somewhere, to sort out pension flow from Derbyshire County Council. I had a small (but very useful) monthly sum coming from there. Caroline worked at a DCC special needs place for a few years, I inherited her pension. It stalled a couple of months ago, I missed some kind of update step. I did do a little towards sorting it out, in the process discovered that I&#39;m probably due some funds from the years I worked at High Peak College.</p>
<p>Software plumbing...things to join together. Separate posts here for them.</p>

    <h1>Pivots</h1>
<p><em>Thinking aloud to find the actionables</em>.</p>
<p>Two artificial deadlines I want to set myself. I&#39;ve got some vocab in-progress for expressing these, the term being #:pivot. There are two dates coming soon for good markers :</p>
<ol>
<li>Poggi Pivot : Mari&#39;s birthday, 2024-01-05</li>
<li>Proof Pivot : my birthday, 2024-01-14</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one, primary goal is getting <strong>some</strong> docs online for <strong>all</strong> my currently active projects. Skeleton summaries/placeholders at minimum, the #:what, a little #:how. But I really want to capture how they relate to each other, the #:why. </p>
<p>The second one, primary goal is creating a proof-of-concept for each project. The minimum here again is little more than skeletal placeholders. But again, capture of the interrelations is the part I&#39;m aiming for. Get the overall dependency graph formalised enough that it can be used in planning. It&#39;s twisty.</p>
<p>Ok, I&#39;ve got actionables (not far off what I was doing already). For #:PoggiPivot, first step is to wire up all the #:postcraft spaces, make them live.
In quasi-parallel, towards #:ProofPivot, two must-haves : write down core project description for each, maybe in a proposal-like form; write down the #:poc requirements.</p>
<p>This lot in itself is a major grind. But I need to remind myself where I&#39;m up to with everything. Best way to do this and keep it interesting is to see what I have noted for next step #:todos, code up the next little step.</p>
<p>I just did this with #:tbox. While going over it with Claude he gave me an architectural diagram (in Mermaid format) which I found really helpful. I&#39;ve already got visualisations on the lists, but I reckon this is an aspect I should revisit very soon, to help with <em>everything else</em>.</p>

    <h1>DB</h1>
<p><em>I&#39;ve got drum &amp; bass playing</em></p>
<p>Brain slow today because I had a very late night. But I&#39;m quite happy with that, because I actually made it into the music room for a couple of hours. I&#39;m working on a suite of tracks that will share some common elements. What was the word for those 70s prog rock...gottit, I want to make a <strong>concept album</strong>. Unlike virtually all the prog rocks, I want this thing to be interesting.
Anyway, there was a specific idea I wanted to try. The music room has often been painful recently, random bits of gear failing. So I was expecting to waste loads of time being the engineer. Except - everything worked a treat. I got a good first draft of the idea down. In the early hours, this particular part is at 160 bpm. After a couple of hours of that my body had gone a bit hyper. So I ended up taking Claudio for a walk at 5 am. Was enjoyable in a Blair Witch Project way.</p>
<h2>tbox</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing a bit more on this. I need some advice on DNS handling, but to get that out of Claude I need to let him known what I&#39;m trying to do with #:tbox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need your advice on DNS handling. Please consider the following description and tell me your recommendations. The goal of the tbox project is to create an intelligent agent ecosystem, including a knowledgebase, in a Docker container. It will interact with the outside world primarily through HTTP (using custom node services) and the XMPP protocol. It is intended to be used in two ways : as a development environment on a desktop computer or as an online service. Online, I plan to use a domain I control, <code>strandz.it</code>, possibly with services on subdomains eg. <code>xmpp.strandz.it</code>. I already have nginx set up on the server for routing with https support, so it&#39;s fine for the Docker container to expose regular http &amp; xmpp ports without encryption. Locally, a priority is to be able to do selective hot code updates while leaving other services on the container, eg. fuseki and prosody live.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, after a few cycles Claude gave me some material that looks good, I&#39;ve saved as-is under:</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Project docs are a priority for me right now. But interdependencies are crazy-convoluted.</p>
<p>First problem is identifying the projects...</p>
<p>Most of the things I&#39;ve been most active with recently are still early-stage as Claude projects and/or on notes I&#39;ve got scattered around, or in repos which appear two dirs on my office machine. I&#39;ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>First I need to remind myself where I was up to with :</p>
<ul>
<li>#:tbox - a Docker container for <em>stuff</em>, most relevant right know, <strong>knowledgebases</strong></li>
<li>#:semem - a <strong>knowledgebase interface</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>tbox</h2>
<p>Hah! I&#39;d got further than I remembered. The Job One <a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/">Fuseki SPARQL Server</a> is already in place. Exposed at <a href="http://localhost:4030">http://localhost:4030</a></p>
<p>Looks like I got <a href="https://prosody.im/">Prosody IM Server</a> in there too, but I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t tested.</p>
<p>I need to get #:transmissions and other core #:hyperdata projects in here too.</p>
<p>Because I need #:semem to organise my existing docs.</p>
<p><strong>I saved a link about setting up Docker as a dev container, best read that first.</strong></p>
<h2>semem</h2>
<p>Dog walk now, coffee with Mari &amp; plumbing supplies run soon. </p>

    <h1>Indigestion</h1>
<p><em>Despite in being traditional to overeat at this time of year, it&#39;s not me but my code that&#39;s got tummy ache.</em></p>
<p>This blog now has an <a href="https://danny.ayers.name/atom.xml">Atom Feed</a>. I&#39;ve only done an eyeball check, but it looks ok.</p>
<p>The other night I had a quick stab at adding this. Claude gave me some convincing-looking code, which didn&#39;t work. I only had a quick look then, it looked like it might take a while to fix. It turned out to be easy, but only once I&#39;d figured out what my #:postcraft code (from months ago) was doing, which took ages. My bad, I&#39;m not surprised Claude got things wrong, my stuff was well obfuscated.</p>
<p>The immediate issue was in the handling of <code>manifest.ttl</code>, the purpose of which in this case was to provide <code>danny.ayers.name</code> site-specific information to the <code>postcraft</code> #:transmissions application. I was already well aware that a bunch of <strong>refactoring</strong> was needed around the <code>transmissions.ttl</code>/<code>config.ttl</code>/<code>manifest.ttl</code> <strong>separation of concerns</strong>. It turned out to be worse than I thought : the handling of <code>manifest.ttl</code> was pretty much <strong>hardcoded</strong> in <code>src/processors/rdf/ConfigMap.js</code>. <strong>Ops!</strong></p>
<p>To get a feed rendering, as a quick workaround I copy &amp; pasted the method that handled the <strong>RDF resource</strong> <code>t:IndexPage</code> and tweaked for <code>t:AtomFeed</code>.</p>
<p>Not pretty, but it&#39;ll do for now. That was a useful exercise, it added another flag to a specific group of #:todos, pushing up their priority in my head. What it <strong>should</strong> have done is push up the priorities declared in the project description, managed by #:farelo. Which pushes the in-progress #:farelo up priorities (in my head).</p>
<p>Associated with that is <strong>all project docs</strong>, already high on my priorities.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not in the mood for being systematic today, but today that&#39;s fine. To get the docs together I need to poke around with all the subprojects, remind myself where I&#39;m at, write down their descriptions, current status &amp; todos (which will ultimately be fed into #:farelo).
I can pick any part I fancy to play around with and in doing so I&#39;m doing something that will be close to critical paths.</p>
<p>But right now, #:dogwalk #2 before it gets dark.</p>
