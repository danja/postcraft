    <h1>Semem Fix &amp; Deploy</h1>
<p><strong>A little pause while I publish these scraps so I can tell Graham what reminded me of him.</strong></p>
<p>I made a todo list here yesterday without any explanation. Didn&#39;t publish. Invisible todo list is absolutely not what I want on my blog front page! My top priority this week is doc organisation, so I&#39;ll let myself off this time. I&#39;ve changed the date on the file, this is it I&#39;ll now fill it out...</p>
<p>I&#39;d had a chat with ClaudioB, pointed him to my notes so far on <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a>. He asked me if I had a <strong>live instance</strong> he could play with. A very good question! Not for the first time I&#39;ll quote -</p>
<h2>Connolly&#39;s Bane</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;The bane of my existence is doing things that I know the
computer could do for me&quot;</strong>
\â€“ Dan Connolly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Which reminded me I&#39;ve not been in touch with <a href="https://www.ninebynine.org/">Graham Klyne</a> for many years. A blog post of his drew my attention to that quote. Good-o, he&#39;s on Mastodon : <a href="https://indieweb.social/@gklyne">@gklyne@indieweb.social</a>, I&#39;ll ping him there.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pause</strong></p>
<p>It totally ties in with agent-oriented messaging. This is the kind of message I want my systems to be able to deal with automatically.
Somewhere around my vocabs I need terms for this particular kind of input. I may already have something like <strong>Feature Request</strong> around the project management oriented bits, but</p>

    <h1>Happy New Year!</h1>
<p>Foggy brain yet again. Not for the first time on New Year&#39;s Day, but irritatingly I wasn&#39;t up all that late and didn&#39;t drink to excess. I did have fun last night, my first attempt at livestreaming. Around 7pm I was feeling blocked at desk (my head, not the code) and an idea formed in my head. I&#39;d been listening to Drum &amp; Bass. Didn&#39;t seem right, hmm, bagpipes? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjdnGNfDyd4">Big Bad Bollocks</a>? Pogues? Hang on, is there any D&amp;B in 3/4 or 6/8 time? I decided to make some. By midnight.    </p>
<p>Easiest camera to set up was my Android phone (after I spent half an hour sorting out a tripod). Perplexity suggested Facebook was the easiest platform, but neglected to tell me it has a very confusing UI with sod all settings accessible. Worst, whatever resolution/codec it uses, it&#39;s a network glutton. I&#39;m not sure how much actually got streamed, 50% of the times I checked it was waiting to connect.  </p>

    <h1>Semem POC</h1>
<p><em>First-thing morning ramblings, deep sea trawling for actionables again</em></p>
<p>I have two upcoming deadlines I&#39;ve set myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:PoggiPivot 2025-01-05 - get my #:hyperdata project docs sorted</li>
<li>#:ProofPivot 2025-01-14 - proofs of concept for projects</li>
</ul>
<p>Both racing towards me. But that&#39;s the whole idea, use the purely artificial urgency to motivate myself to <strong>focus</strong>. Success at achieving the goals is secondary, reflected in the fact I haven&#39;t actually written down those criteria yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, since setting these I&#39;ve made a good start on them for <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a> (Semantic Memory). Which has highlighted one particular flaw in my current processes, that <strong>proof of concept</strong> isn&#39;t actually the phrase I intended in the above.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere</em>, probably in a Claude project, hopefully condensed in a vocab, I have (work on) better terms. But I need to get my docs sorted...</p>
<p>The phrase is/should be closer to <strong>minimum viable product</strong>. But I don&#39;t like this phrase because <strong>product</strong> <em>in this context, in my mind</em> suggests a marketable commodity. As a dyed in the wool Capitalism-sceptic, I have a knee-jerk reaction to this kind of thing. In society at large there is an overarching conflation between a thing&#39;s value in a &quot;noble&quot; utilitarian sense and it&#39;s bottom line <strong>$ value</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Aside</strong> : I have a vague memory of having the same kind of reaction while tech-reviewing some book material by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Powers">Shelley Powers</a> a good few years ago. <em>(This may be a completely false memory, apologies to Shelley if that&#39;s the case, but it is plausible and moreover nicely fits this narrative, &quot;don&#39;t let the truth get in way...&quot; and all that).</em>  Shelley is one of my heros of the Web-tech world, and a bloody good writer. But in this particular chapter she made repeated use of phrases like &quot;business rules&quot;. Which I repeatedly criticised. There is a legitimate definition of &quot;business&quot; in this context, to paraphrase &quot;the important stuff&quot;. But still in my mind the conflation with business in the common-English commercial activity sense made my hackles rise. </p>
<p>(Btw, I am an experienced reviewer, and key to that role is drawing attention to text that <em>might not</em> be quite right. It might well be fine. But I&#39;d say the diligent reviewer should err a little on the side of caution, flag things where suspicions are raised. As an experienced writer, Shelley would know many of such flags were tentative, a legitimate response being to reject them after a cursory mental check - which she probably did in this instance, if it ever happened. For sure, iffy crit is a pain and any crit can be demoralising when you get a downpour (I&#39;d be one of many reviewers doing this). But the patience of Job and thick skin are job requirements.)</p>
<p>Any road... I do hope I did get some clear and accurate terminology nailed down for POC/MVC. Neutral language in the sense of not carrying misleading baggage. What I&#39;m after is more like &quot;demonstration of utility&quot;. <strong>Clunky, eh</strong>.</p>
<h2>Semem Demonstration of Utility</h2>
<p>I delighted myself with the hubris I got into my working description of #:semem :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a> is an LLM-compatible context-aware, open-ended graph knowledgebase system combining the advantages of vector embeddings and Linked Data technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what am I aiming for by 2025-01-14? I actually have an immediate use case with low-end requirements :</p>
<p><strong>A system I can point to my local FS containing scattered markdown notes etc etc so I can use the stuff efficiently.</strong></p>
<p>I reckon a baseline #:Semem needs to :</p>
<ul>
<li>provide simple similarity search</li>
<li>cluster related topics at different scales</li>
<li>create quasi-formalised annotation (metadata)</li>
<li>make a disorganised, heterogenous corpus addressable as a coherent entity</li>
<li>exploit LLMs (and maybe trad reasoning) to facilitate new knowledge discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, I have some actionables. Mari&#39;s picking me up in 15 mins to go for a coffee and I&#39;m not yet out of bed.</p>

    <h1>Semem SPARQ</h1>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a> doesn&#39;t quite SPARQL yet</em></p>
<p>I was able to sort out the Faiss API issues from earlier so dove right ahead in implementing storage for #:semem that uses a remote SPARQL endpoint. Well, not quite -</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Executed 45 of 45 specs (4 ERRORS) (33 FAILED) in 1 sec.
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danja/semem/blob/main/src/SPARQLExample.js">SPARQLExample.js</a> also fails miserably, when it tries to <code>UPDATE</code>. This might well be a problem with the target SPARQL store (Fuseki in the #:tbox Docker), I only set that up yesterday (?), haven&#39;t tested it properly yet. I suspect <strong>auth</strong>.</p>
<p>As usual Claude did most of the donkey work for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danja/semem/blob/main/src/stores/SPARQLStore.js">SPARQLStore.js</a> (and there&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem/blob/main/src/stores/CachedSPARQLStore.js">CachedSPARQLStore.js</a>) just use simple templating to create the SPARQL. But that&#39;s all it needs right now.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">_generateInsertStatements(memories, type) {
    return memories.map((interaction, index) =&gt; `
        _:interaction${type}${index} a mcp:Interaction ;
            mcp:id &quot;${interaction.id}&quot; ;
            mcp:prompt &quot;${this._escapeSparqlString(interaction.prompt)}&quot; ;
            mcp:output &quot;${this._escapeSparqlString(interaction.output)}&quot; ;
            mcp:embedding &quot;&quot;&quot;${JSON.stringify(interaction.embedding)}&quot;&quot;&quot; ;
            mcp:timestamp &quot;${interaction.timestamp}&quot;^^xsd:integer ;
            mcp:accessCount &quot;${interaction.accessCount}&quot;^^xsd:integer ;
            mcp:concepts &quot;&quot;&quot;${JSON.stringify(interaction.concepts)}&quot;&quot;&quot; ;
            mcp:decayFactor &quot;${interaction.decayFactor}&quot;^^xsd:decimal ;
            mcp:memoryType &quot;${type}&quot; .
    `).join(&#39;\n&#39;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, I finally found a use for the <a href="https://purl.org/stuff/mcp">Model Context Protocol Ontology</a> Claude &amp; I put together almost a month ago.</p>
