    <h1>Misty</h1>
<p><em>It was very misty this afternoon for dogwalk</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve a misty head today, now to ramble a bit to see what condenses.</p>
<p>Nice reminder, #:todo #:squirt handle images etc.</p>
<p>It also reminded me of the name of Led Zep&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6M3YQ_EF2E">Misty Mountain Hop</a>, but I couldn&#39;t think why that might stick in my head until I had a listen. I really like that &quot;<strong>dog dog dog, doggy dog dog...</strong>&quot;. I bet I&#39;ve already played with it somewhere, but I haven&#39;t a clue where.</p>
<p>This leads straight to my <strong>misty memory</strong>. My memory for day-to-day things is pretty lousy, main workaround being written reminders, lists and lists and lists... But I&#39;ve actually got an exceptionally good memory for things around tech and suchlike, <em>in a sense</em>. Like, the capacity and retention of system ideas is really good, but the connectivity between them is poor, retrieval can often be hopeless. (This is almost certainly an #:adhd thing).</p>
<p>One specific issue comes up regularly. If I&#39;ve got a plan for something worked out, but haven&#39;t been active on it for a little while, I forget which bits I&#39;ve done. Very often I imagine I&#39;ve implemented something I haven&#39;t even started, but that&#39;s not a major problem, because at that point I&#39;ll have a pretty good idea of how to do it. A fun, kind-of example of this is a (probably false) memory I have, of having a dream where I was playing the guitar chords to &quot;Wild Thing&quot; before I&#39;d learned them. Following day I could play it.
I strongly suspect this is a false memory because at the time it would have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVN8_7wVSG0">Hendrix&#39;s version</a> I&#39;d have had most exposure to, and the version I learned in the dream was open G-C-D-C-G chords on a nylon-strung acoustic, rather different. <em>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zN2wWGbGyM">Goodies version</a> is quite a thing, though the classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSWInYFVksg">Troggs version</a> would be my go-to these days. Now where did I leave that ocarina..?</em>  </p>
<p>The converse of this is a relatively minor problem, but one that&#39;s incredibly annoying when it happens. I forget I&#39;ve implemented something and proceed to implement it again. Like buying eggs &amp; potatoes when you&#39;ve already got a larder full of eggs &amp; potatoes. Except they can go into extra <em>tortillas espa√±olas</em>.   </p>
<h2>Actionable : Docs!</h2>
<p>Ah...ok, something has condensed. Sort out project docs. The #:postcraft doc rendering bits are still fresh in my head, this would be a good opportunity. I did a #:transmission a while back to pull a list of my <a href="https://github.com/danja?tab=repositories">GitHub repos</a>. My plan then was to have it pull the <code>README.md</code> for each, use those to bootstrap docs. Slight snag, few had a worthwhile readme, certainly not up-to-date.</p>
<p>But I should be able to identify the currently active repos (they&#39;ll be a bit tangled up in Claude projects too - I&#39;ve quite a lot there yet to find a proper home). There&#39;s my starting point. Writing some readmes should give me good anchor points from which to bootstrap the rest.</p>
<p>First though, a dogwalk in the dark.</p>

    <h1>Solstice</h1>
<p><em>It&#39;s the shortest day!</em></p>
<p>I&#39;m ambivalent about Christmas, don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever partaken of any of the other rituals of the season. But I sure do celebrate the <strong>winter solstice</strong>, in spirit if not in much action (I plan to get a few <strong>beers</strong> later). I can explain best by quoting a late friend of mine :    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nights are drawing in.&quot;
- Geoff Beswick of Priestcliffe (every year soon after 21st June)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I don&#39;t suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a> in the clinical sense. But I&#39;m a late riser, short days (with the associated unpleasant weather) really do impact my mood, however indirectly. So here, I&#39;ll claim the quote :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nights are drawing out!&quot;</p>

<h2>More Postcraft</h2>
<p>Grrr. Returning to the #:postcraft bits from yesterday, I just discovered a bug that&#39;s crept into #:transmissions. I wanted to check how the paths are allocated, so went to isolate that particular operation. But...</p>
<p>The command :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./trans postcraft.copy ../postcraft/danny.ayers.name
</code></pre>
<p>should only run the subsection of the application <code>postcraft</code> called <code>copy</code>. This is a single #:transmission (= pipeline) in  <a href="/static/artifacts/postcraft/2024-12-20/transmissions.ttl">transmissions.ttl</a>. I did put the wiring in place for this, but <strong>fool Danny</strong> once again didn&#39;t get around to giving it a corresponding <strong>test</strong>. Or did I..?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm run test
</code></pre>
<p>-bombs straight out with an error during a test on the <code>FilenameMapper</code> processor (still no idea if there&#39;s a test for the <code>transmissions.sub</code> selector).</p>
<p>Hah! <strong>Fool Danny</strong> once again forgot to run <strong>tests</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Bloody hell</em>, all I wanted to do with this when I got to desk yesterday was to fix a trivial CSS bug.</p>
<p>I suppose I&#39;d best just put a bandaid on the CSS for now, then check the tests. I&#39;ve been meaning to set up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD">CI/CD</a> bits on GitHub for a while... (I really want such things embedded in #:transmissions itself, so it can notify of any problems preemptively, declare it&#39;s own status - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing">Shift-Left</a> to the max).</p>
<p>Heh ho. I&#39;ll have to leave that for now, got some jobs to do that require <strong>daylight</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Layout</h1>
<p>With Claude&#39;s help (I gave the <code>index.html</code> + CSS files as attachments), I&#39;ve fixed the immediate layout bug I had here. My system prompt (which I&#39;ll post in a mo) asks Claude for suggestions, and after this it suggested :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>q4: Should we implement a sticky header or navigation elements?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sticky menu button was already in my todos, so I went <code>q4</code>. Claude gave me a bunch of code using React.  To which I responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be vanilla JS, please revise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I have a sticky button! I&#39;ll populate it later, daylight activities to do.</p>
<p>When I tried it on my phone it still wasn&#39;t quite right, but clearing the cache sorted it out. So I&#39;ve added this -</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- #:todo remove when stable --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Cache-Control&quot; content=&quot;no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Pragma&quot; content=&quot;no-cache&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Expires&quot; content=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The stuff here is all lightweight, so that may stay a while.</p>
<p>All good!</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t give a fuck about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> in the marketing sense, but I do care very deeply about information being maximally available, accurate and reusable (according to relevance, supplied with context, provenance etc. Something like, er, <strong>knowledge</strong>).</p>

<p>Yes mate. Also, dear Anthropic etc, if I want advice from Reddit I know how to get that <strong>dreckly</strong>, employing a Web browser and my own primate reasoning.</p>
<h2>Aside</h2>
<p>I noted this elsewhere the other night, this afternoon one of the clickbaity things told me OpenAI had achieved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence">AGI</a>. Because it did better than another benchmark. Pardon my French again, <del>two</del> three &quot;fuck&quot;s in a single post. <strong>Fucking shite</strong> (1.5 cent in the sweary token box?). Anyway, I do have a lot to say about this, will be tagged #:linguefranche - nah, #:l. It&#39;s very important IMO, a one-l ref here.</p>
<p>Only a few times have I seen myself quoted, and I cannot express the magnitude of buzz I got. Like <em>danja says...</em>. Maybe Freudian parent thing, maybe just screaming into the void forever...
So please :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If even a small LM can make a good prediction of a stream of text, might it be the case that rather than the LM being intelligent, the text is stupid?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruAi4VBoBSM">stars/gutter</a></em></p>
<p>This is a point at which I believe work is needed (<em>doing my best</em>). The material chatty GPTs are trained on, text, is a lowered-dimension expression of a sliver of the multimodal communication between a particular kind of animals. Yeah, for animal evolution, it enables transcendence. But it&#39;s still a really shitty (sweary token!) serial protocol that evolved when us hominid critters tried co-existing. For it to be useful, it needs a agent either end to have a really fucking (0.05c sweary tokens now) good model of the universe. Mountains of abstraction (John Sowa says ontology is necessary, I&#39;d go further). Not just either end, but societies of extremely multimodal co-evolving agents. Ok, it&#39;s quite miraculous I can string a sentence together these days given the booze I&#39;ve got through. But I can&#39;t express myself in English, or pour myself a glass of beer through some kind of monolithic intelligence I carry. The very millisecond I thought of that, I have this screen in front of me, I also heard a little crack from the fire downstairs. Claudio will be dozing on the couch in front of it, but that would be below the threshold to make him jump. I&#39;m aware of this other autonomous agent in my proximity. I&#39;m aware of several other active agents that are active but physically separated (Easy, you have a go. First that spring to mind, ok, two 6km away (Mari &amp; cat Batu, I&#39;d give 100:1 I could give their location within 20cm), another 2,000km (cousin Jonny - more dice with which of the 3 in the 90%, that I can describe with accuracy, one I&#39;ve never been to), in the sense I can make an internal model of what they are doing right now.</p>
<p>More, the models we carry - initially evolved not far from a GPT model, pre-trained for reactivity (in a very complex environment), are incredibly plastic. Our language in the texty sense, psychological, technical senses is sooooo crude for mapping reality. The internals only work because of the ability to maintain a form of just-enough pattern-match for this moment. Statement on this : I don&#39;t see any reason why AI can&#39;t surpass what we call human intelligence in the near future. But the current state of the art is really, really, really, really shit (3.0c? or should that be 4x?) compared to the stuff I saw in the rat that came out of the dogfood bag on the balcony earlier.  </p>
<p><em>Does Artificial General Intelligence cover other physics than our own, and any comcomitant perceived realities? If not why not..?</em>          </p>
<p>The biggest stupidity in all this is easy to qualify. Human exceptionalism. For fuck&#39;s sake, my fucking dog (oops, &gt;= 5 sweary tokens) recently learnt how to squeeze my hand. A while back a friend introduced him to <code>zampa</code> (paw) as a means of getting a treat. Soon after he figured out how to use it as a means of expression (his speech &amp; typing skills are limited). Because he showed me by example, <strong>the dog taught me</strong> the signs, I know the difference between about maybe 6 different things that are directly actionable things he wants me to do. But the zampa is a broad word meaning &quot;attention please&quot;. Context is crucial, like any comms (Amazon or OnlyFriends?). Lying on the couch in front of the fire, both of us dozing, he&#39;ll gentle-zampa in a way I understand to mean acknowledging my presence. It seemed very sweet, so I hold his zampa, and give it a little squeeze, anthropomorphicaly. Except <strong>fuck anthropomorphism</strong> (6). Those encounters now, he does a gentle zampa, I hold his paw, he pulls in his toes and (to the best of his ability) gives my hand a squeeze. No direct training involved. He&#39;s motivated to communicate with me (best friends - food too, but Danny isn&#39;t just a feedy machine, Claudio isn&#39;t just an eaty machine), so he find ways of doing so. That I&#39;d call a decent goal for the computational systems, not some wanky contrived text recognition benchmark (0.01? I&#39;ve forgotten my sweary weights here, cunt (+1)).     </p>
<p>Fuck me (+1). Good cue. Claudio just came up to tell me the fire&#39;s gone out.</p>

    <h1>Claude System Prompt</h1>
<p>The prompt I use with Claude projects is continually changing, and being tweaked per-project. Below is the one I&#39;ve currently got for #:transmissions, I think it&#39;s the most recent. Size-wise, when used with a heap of Project knowledge the context window does get a bit stretched. The <strong>handover</strong> document is useful. After a few cycles in a chat session, some little job done, I use it to give a bit of recent memory to the next session. The RDF rendition I&#39;m recording to give to #:farelo (project management) later. (I&#39;ll be glad when I&#39;ve got all this automated. <em>Work in progress...</em>).</p>
<p>The q1, q2... part is really good. Very often one suggestion is exactly what I want next, so it saves typing. Quite often there are suggestions that are good ideas I hadn&#39;t thought of. Good machine-human colab, innit.</p>
<p>I frequently do an export from Claude. I&#39;ve got a #:transmissions application <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions/tree/main/src/applications/claude-json-converter">claude-json-converter</a> to split the big JSON file into smaller dirs of markdown files. It&#39;s rough &amp; ready, but good enough to enable me to usefully search the stuff (and should be usable with RAG later).</p>
<p>Time for a solstice beer.</p>
