    <h1>Matches</h1>
<p>I had a very distracting trip to the UK, and now I&#39;m trying to pick up from where I left off with code projects. I started yesterday, but my brain wasn&#39;t yet in gear, so went for something near the top of my to-dos, Install Aider Composer #:link. Did that, called it a day.</p>
<p>This morning when I got to desk the machine was playing silly buggers, so I had to start with an hour of tedious sysadmin.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, got to my code proper. Apparently I&#39;d made a good start on #:squirt, essentially (for now) a simple bit of HTML form-based UI for posting stuff to a SPARQL server. I&#39;d been working with Claude Projects, starting with quite a lengthy requirements spec and a bunch of relevant knowledge files.</p>
<p>I ran the latest <code>npm build dev</code>, which is hooked into webpack #:link for bundling. I&#39;m using vanilla JS but a key dependency is the RDF-Ext lib #:link. When opening what should have been a form, I got an error : <code>dataset.removeMatches()</code>. I&#39;ve not got my workflow for Aider Composer figured out yet, and couldn&#39;t be bothered doing another cycle with Claude just yet. Plan C : <strong>view source</strong>. Took 2 mins to find that it should have been <code>dataset.deleteMatches()</code>. Claude may have been drawing on an old version of the RDF-Ext material, but I had given it a bunch of current code in the Project knowledge, so maybe it just got mixed up/hallucinated.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s me reminded re. #:squirt. While away, the state of my current online material went under the headlights a couple of times, so that&#39;s been pushed up priorities. Make <strong>this</strong> look nice!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also got loads of fairly urgent real world stuff to do this week, like taking down a couple of trees. Sunny today, so I&#39;d better make a start on that.</p>
<p>Dogwalk first.  </p>

    <h1>Aider Composer</h1>
<p>Installing <a href="https://github.com/lee88688/aider-composer">Aider Composer</a> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> extension.</p>
<p><em>This took me a silly amount of time, I&#39;d better make a note.</em></p>
<p>I installed the extension from VSCode&#39;s package section. Nothing showed up, so <strong>RTFM</strong>.</p>
<p>The instructions were clear (in retrospect):</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Python</li>
<li>Install the required packages using: <code>pip install aider-chat flask</code></li>
<li>In VSCode, set <code>aider-composer.pythonPath</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;d already got Python, but I&#39;ve had a lot of distractions since I last used it. I know I was using <code>venv</code> for something last time, but can&#39;t remember quite how. So for 2. I just went global, as it&#39;s written above. This took a while and produced <em>lots</em> of output, but on the last few lines I only saw warnings, so went straight on to 3.</p>
<p>For 3. the docs say :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The directory containing the Python executable (not the Python executable path itself) where aider.chat and flask packages are installed. This setting is required for the extension to activate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did a fair bit of hunting, starting with :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">which python3
...
/home/danny/.local/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>Looking around there, it seemed <code>/home/danny/.local/bin</code> contained loads of Python binaries so I put that in. Turned out this was what was needed, although <strong>Aider Composer still wasn&#39;t showing up</strong>. Backtrack...</p>
<p>The <code>pip install aider-chat flask</code> hadn&#39;t worked. Not even close. Two root issues : I&#39;d already got an <strong>older version</strong> of <a href="https://aider.chat">Aider</a> (command line) installed; <strong>dependency hell</strong>.</p>
<p>So I started by following instructions to update Aider, which failed, but did give some clues.
<strong>The fix</strong> I found was to run this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">python -m pip install aider-chat --force
</code></pre>
<p>  - which would fail with dependency errors. So I went through each of those using this syntax pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pip install &quot;matplotlib&gt;=3.8&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>- trying the <code>aider-chat</code> install again, fixing next error. Finally success.</p>
<p>Back into <strong>VSCode</strong>, and the extension was now showing up. <strong>Woo-hoo!</strong> But the output log had this :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">2024-12-15 13:39:00.883 [info] Starting aider-chat service...
2024-12-15 13:39:00.883 [warning] Multiple workspace folders found, skip starting aider-chat service.
</code></pre>
<p>Took me a while to twig. The workspace I had open had 4 or 5 project folders in it. When I did <code>Open Folder...</code> on a <strong>single project</strong>, the service started up ok.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>Aider Composer settings</strong>. Which API/model? I&#39;ve got a few $s left on the Anthropic API (<em>few</em>, because <a href="https://github.com/cline/cline">Cline</a> had been very greedy last time I was there). I didn&#39;t know how to name the model, but googling took me to the <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">aider leaderboard</a>. I went with the top one today, <code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022</code>.</p>
<p>Next I needed an API key. I knew roughly where I&#39;d put one, but it still took a few minutes to find. My dog is called Claudio, I&#39;ve been chatting with ClaudioB recently (who coincidentally recommended to me a few weeks ago). I also had some keep-safe material relating to a couple of prints by the <strong>French</strong> (note that) painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Lorrain">Claude</a> I was trying to sell a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found the API key, put it in, saved settings. All looked good. <strong>Aider Composer chat window</strong>, ok try :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please give a brief description of the current project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Aider Composer Claude</em> responded :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Je ne vois pas encore de code partagé, donc je ne peux pas donner de description du projet pour le moment. Une fois que vous aurez partagé des extraits de code avec moi, je pourrai analyser le projet et vous fournir une description détaillée.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My <strong>French</strong> ain&#39;t tres bonny, but I understood that.</p>
<p>In the source folder I had a concat file of the project made with <a href="https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix">repomix</a>. So I pointed the chat at that and repeated the request above.</p>
<p><em>Really</em> good response. I was a bit confused when it ended with :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q1: Would you like more details about any specific aspect of the architecture? Q2: Are you interested in the RDF/Semantic Web features specifically? Q3: Would you like to know more about the development setup and workflow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very familiar. Ah... The repomix file included a <strong>system prompt</strong> I&#39;d used elsewhere, which included :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After each response, provide three short follow-up questions worded as if I&#39;m asking you. These should help clarify the original topic and identify more detailed avenues of research. Label as Q1, Q2, and Q3. If I say Q1, Q2 or Q3, address the corresponding question. If I say Q0, repeat the previous request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>That&#39;s quite an old version, Ive tweaked since then, but you get the gist.</em></p>
<p>Kinda cool that Claude read the prompt as a prompt.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all looking good, time for a break.</p>

    <h1>Wake On Lan</h1>
<p><em>Last night I got it set up on the office machine. This morning in bed I set up the client side (<code>apt install wakeonlan</code>) on the phone, switched on office machine from there, set up VNC. It&#39;s Magic!</em></p>
<p>I noticed a Claude session I&#39;d forgotten about, related to #:WebHooks in #:transmissions - <em>hookers</em> in fact. Can&#39;t remember where I got to, but need to revisit when I&#39;m integrating the <code>HttpServer</code> processor. <a href="https://claude.ai/chat/22c60548-4f26-4bc6-80b4-0720f2329bd5">https://claude.ai/chat/22c60548-4f26-4bc6-80b4-0720f2329bd5</a></p>
<p>#:todo Claude URLs to local files map</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent a long while writing a requirements spec for #:squirt to use in a prompt. Made a start on collecting the material for Project knowledge. Slight annoyance with <code>s/repopack/repomix</code> as I hadn&#39;t tidied up the <code>ignore</code> lists. Anyway, <strong>12:57</strong> so I&#39;ll have an hour on that, then dogwalk.</p>
<p>#:squirt docs currently under <code>/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/farelo/articles/squirt</code></p>
<p>Another thing that should probably go in the knowledge #:storm vocab. I&#39;ve forgotten where I was up to with that...</p>
<p>Ah... Ontology for Filesystem and Web Resources : <code>/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/workspaces/hyperdata/chat-archives/md/d681/2024-11-30_609.md</code></p>
<p><a href="https://claude.ai/chat/d681a668-6827-42e0-b98e-5d02cd43a013">https://claude.ai/chat/d681a668-6827-42e0-b98e-5d02cd43a013</a></p>
<p>Slight distraction. Claude export uses email notification/link. Something else I should automate. Also an agent for my email would be useful given that currently I have <strong>50643</strong> mails in my #:gmail <strong>Inbox</strong>. The count of <strong>Unread</strong> appears to be frequently restarting, I guess as it syncs locally. Right now at <strong>160000</strong>. Did I mention I was diagnosed with #:adhd ? :)</p>
<p>#:hyperdata-desktop support emojis ... one day...</p>
<p>But the email agent is a nice practical use case for #:kia/#:transmissions/#:semem, another human/machine protocol I&#39;d forgotten about.</p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP &lt;-&gt; SPARQL server  </li>
<li>incoming messages -&gt; reader -&gt; notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>#:todo set up mail server on #:hyperdata.it (again).</p>

    <h1>Not Dead</h1>
<p><em>Title has a grim angle and a funny angle. Grim : it sounds like my mother is probably on her way out. My cousin estimates days not weeks, but he has a tendency to think the worst. I&#39;m trying to get more information to find out whether or not I need to fly over (the logistics are difficult, and last time I made the mistake of being too hasty). Funny : Just now on daily dogwalk #1, as we were going up the lane towards the cemetery, it looked like there was someone collapsed in the field just below. As I got closer - yes, definitely a person...small movement... I would have quickened my pace but Claudio already had me at top (not-fall-over) speed. Then I got close enough to see it was a man lying on his side on the ground, with a water drain cover open and him peering inside. Phew!</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a <em>lot</em> of integration &amp; suchlike jobs to do. But pausing that I&#39;m going to do a quick spike of #:squirt.</p>
