<p>#:next proper runner of Fork didn&#39;t quite work, also need to mod all processors for <code>simples</code></p>
<p>#:next try out <code>engine/ModuleLoader.js</code> (docs inside it) for remote processors</p>
<p>Because before getting out of bed I was catching up with WordNet.</p>
<p>I was on a roll yesterday, had a fairly productive coding session until late. Made good progress with #:simples, the minimal #:transmission runner. Main requirement turned out to be trivial, simply return the processed <code>message</code> from <code>processor.execute(message)</code>. For the processors I tried, it Just Worked.</p>
<p>But after sleeping on it, I&#39;ve realised there&#39;s a little snag - processors that fork, like <code>DirWalker</code> currently spawn lots of pipelines, emitting <code>message</code> to each. But how to cover that with <code>simples</code>.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve got processor <code>Fork</code> as a starting point to play with.  </p>
<p>remember I need videos for Spooky release - and music! #:music:tasty</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been doing quite a few real-world odd jobs. Now tired &amp; hungry, but still on a roll...</p>

<h2>3D UI a bit like zz structure</h2>
<p>Use a games engine?</p>

<p>3D cuboid nodes connected with straight line edges. Each with summary info</p>

<p>pan, move, zoom buttons etc</p>
<p>when focused on a given node A there is are lists of nearby (vector) and linked (rdf) nodes</p>

<p>#:md:rdf - thought for #:yars</p>
<p>Default <code>#:</code> namespace will be defined somewhere locally, but namespaces can be changed/defined in an md doc. Maybe <code>#:ns:http://example.org</code> for <code>#:</code> and <code>#:ns:http://example.org/this:th</code> for prefixes.</p>

    <h1>Rainsday</h1>
<p>#:todo:tomorrow replace all <code>Processor</code> lines <code>this.emit(&#39;message&#39;, message)</code> with <code>return super.handle(message)</code></p>
<p>It&#39;s pouring with rain, but I&#39;m hoping to be going out later. When Mari messages to say my meds prescription is ready to pick up, we&#39;ll go ut for that, do a bit of shopping and have a coffee. There&#39;s also a little panelling job for me to do at hers, when convenient.  </p>
<p>Before I got up I did a bit of exploration around formulas for determining task priorities, with much help from Claude AI on the phone. Got to v1 bits for #Farelo.</p>

<p><code>form-a-matic</code> first</p>
<p>get Claude to make a test for extractor.js, sim from form with jsdom</p>
<p><em>Interruption - trip into town.</em></p>
<p><code>form-a-matic</code>  is proceeding ok. But given the new TODOs below, I&#39;m inclined to procrastinate a little to make a little #productivity timesaver.</p>

<p>A #:pain at the moment is the chain of run #:postcraft on projects -&gt; commit projects (in the correct order) -&gt; push -&gt; server pull. I&#39;d better have this as a #:transmission.</p>
<p>...oops, mind wandered from that #:adhd, heh.</p>
<p>Which calls for new processors. Docs can start in #:transmissions:processors (#:specs:md)</p>
<p>Ops, I see #:yars approaching - <strong>Yet another RDF syntax</strong>. I&#39;ve got notes on #md:rdf somewhere, #:todo:link. But this may have potential for quick &amp; dirty inline RDF, eg. #(anchor):seeAlso:<a href="http://url">link</a> ...hmmm...</p>

<p>[1^]:  &quot;pali wan, kama pini tu.&quot;</p>
<p>I just checked back on this :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1fgj8ae/kill_two_birds_with_one_stone/">https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1fgj8ae/kill_two_birds_with_one_stone/</a></p>
<p>There was a new suggestion. So I asked Claude :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the toki pona &quot;pali wan, kama pini tu.&quot; in English?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 The Toki Pona phrase "pali wan, kama pini tu." can be translated to English as:
 "Do one task, finish two."
 This phrase uses the following Toki Pona words:

<p> pali: work, do, make
 wan: one
 kama: to become, to arrive, to bring about
 pini: end, finish, complete
 tu: two</p>
<p> The meaning conveys the idea of efficiency or accomplishing more than expected - by doing one task, you end up completing two things. It&#39;s similar to the English saying &quot;killing two birds with one stone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Posted somewhere in the early hours last night</p>
<p>I really like sound of this version of &#39;Blue Monday&#39;,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLbaOLWjpc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHLbaOLWjpc</a></p>
<p>but there are many, many things about the video that annoy me. A small sample :</p>
<ul>
<li>that&#39;s a cruddy monochord (I made one as a pressie for oor Nigel, much  more practical &amp; prettier)</li>
<li>the sig gen looks at least late 40s</li>
<li>voice short delay effect - how? It&#39;s generally taken that the first time an artificial reverb effect was used was in 1947. The producer&#39;s bathroom, for this : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIuX7IsdE8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BIuX7IsdE8</a></li>
<li>where is the vocal chorus coming from? (Ok, magnetic wire recording had been around a while, tape was just emerging, you could overlay - but they were all really big machines, valve/tube electronics, I don&#39;t see one)</li>
<li>NO-ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MINDS USES RUSTY STRINGS</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all these are coumterbalanced for me by intrigue on the 4-stringed hammered thing (what is that called?) and most of all by imagining - Stephen Morris drum roll, tss tss tss...</p>
<p>Peter Hook playing a banjolele.</p>
<p>(I&#39;ve actually got one, they are probably the most ridiculous instrument in human history. A meeting of the best engineering and craftwor., The end result having the worst features of both banjos and ukuleles.
I&#39;m guessing me dad found it in a charity shop. Has been desperately in need of repair for decades, this might be motivation for me to get around to it. Also the mandolin sharing the same cardboard box I got from a car boot sale years back, which had no back and a broken front, which I <em>did</em> resurrect - so badly it has needed gluing back together since a week after my fix- accursed kerfs!).</p>
<p>How does it feel?</p>
