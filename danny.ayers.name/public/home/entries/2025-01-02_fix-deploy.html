    <h1>Semem Fix &amp; Deploy</h1>
<p><strong>A little pause while I publish these scraps so I can tell Graham what reminded me of him.</strong></p>
<p>I made a todo list here yesterday without any explanation. Didn&#39;t publish. Invisible todo list is absolutely not what I want on my blog front page! My top priority this week is doc organisation, so I&#39;ll let myself off this time. I&#39;ve changed the date on the file, this is it I&#39;ll now fill it out...</p>
<p>A little job for this morning is a little explore of <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a>.</p>
<p>It appears to (mostly) work, here&#39;s the <a href="https://danny.ayers.name/entries/2025-01-01_semem-run.html">console log of a run</a>.</p>
<p>But, <strong>what is it doing?</strong></p>
<p>What I want right now, as a bit of scaffolding for what I want to explore, is a nodejs version of <a href="https://github.com/caspianmoon/memoripy">memoripy</a> that uses a (remote) SPARQL store as (part of) its knowledgebase.</p>
<p>I only tried running it after many hours implementing it in a Claude project. Then had a couple of hours manually tweaking to get it to (mostly) run. It&#39;s definitely interacting with Ollama for embeddings &amp; chat, a SPARQL endpoint for persistence. I don&#39;t see the extracted concepts in the SPARQL store, but there&#39;s a JSON syntax bug mentioned in the trace, that might well be related.  </p>
<p>Last night I had a short session with Claude, aiming to document what we had so far. I&#39;ve put the artifacts over here : <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem/tree/main/docs/description_2025-01-01.md">https://github.com/danja/semem/tree/main/docs/description_2025-01-01.md</a> It sounds marvellous, but how much is true?</p>
<h1>Banebane</h1>
<p>I had a chat with ClaudioB yesterday morning, pointed him to my notes so far on #:semem. He asked me if I had a <strong>live instance</strong> he could play with. A very good question! Not for the first time I&#39;ll quote -</p>
<h2>Connolly&#39;s Bane</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;The bane of my existence is doing things that I know the
computer could do for me&quot;</strong>
\â€“ Dan Connolly</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Which reminded me I&#39;ve not been in touch with <a href="https://www.ninebynine.org/">Graham Klyne</a> for many years. A blog post of his drew my attention to that quote. Good-o, he&#39;s on Mastodon : <a href="https://indieweb.social/@gklyne">@gklyne@indieweb.social</a>, I&#39;ll ping him there.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pause</strong></p>
<p>It totally ties in with agent-oriented messaging. This is the kind of message I want my systems to be able to deal with automatically.
Somewhere around my vocabs I need terms for this particular kind of input. I may already have something like <strong>Feature Request</strong> around the project management oriented bits, but</p>
