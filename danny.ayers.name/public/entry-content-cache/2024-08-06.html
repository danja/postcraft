    <h1>Coolbag</h1>
<p>Mari dropped off some food for me that someone had given her.</p>
<p>First today I&#39;d better finish off <code>/home/danny/github-danny/transmissions/docs/postcraft-site/articles/new-application-walkthrough.md</code></p>
<p>The disorganisation of my docs is doing my head in.</p>
<p>If I get that ^^^ going, add doc indexing</p>
<p>I also need to look into other interaction paradigms for working with AI - beyond Chat (with doc) etc.</p>
<p>A piece of #Farelo is really gnawing at my brain. The task-alignment part.</p>
<p>I also need to get #LibreChat set up before I go much further.</p>
<p><strong>LibreChat</strong> - look if there are any bits of it I can use with transmissions, AND see if I can attach it to transmissions</p>
