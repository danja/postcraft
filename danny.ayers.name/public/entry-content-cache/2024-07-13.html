<p>Recommendations</p>
<h4>For Upscaling:</h4>
<p>RealSR (Upscale Realistic): This model is designed for realistic upscaling, which is suitable for an academic presentation video as it will preserve the natural look and details.</p>
<p>SPAN (Upscale General + Animation): This model can handle general upscaling tasks well and might be a good option if RealSR is too resource-intensive.</p>
<h4>For Interpolation:</h4>
<p>IFRNET (Interpolate General): This is a general-purpose interpolation model and should be less demanding on resources compared to RIFE. It can help smooth out the video and improve its overall appearance.
RIFE (Interpolate General): Although generally effective, it can be more demanding. If IFRNET does not yield satisfactory results, consider RIFE as an alternative.</p>
