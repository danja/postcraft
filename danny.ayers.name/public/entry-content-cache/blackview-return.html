<p>I would like my BV6200 phone repaired under warranty.The USB connector no longer works, it doesn&#39;t charge. It began by being intermittent, it needed the connector at a particular angle. Now it doesn&#39;t work at all. The charger and cable work correctly, I have tried them on another phone. I have also tried a different charger and cable (from another Blackview phone), same issue.
I have had it for about 7 months and have been careful with it. At night I put it on charge, in the morning when I detach I cover the connector hole. I have looked closely inside (torch &amp; magnifying glass) - no sign of dirt or other blockage.</p>
