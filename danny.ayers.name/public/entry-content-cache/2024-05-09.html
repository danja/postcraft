<p>Ok, I need to figure a system for the sketchy daily todos. They so often carry over... Maybe monthly files?</p>
<p>Also, now I want to look at topologies in Transmissions using Postcraft as the example, where to put those notes?</p>
<p>I guess defaulting to the journal is a good idea. Later move any conclusions to the appropriate project-specific location.</p>
<ul>
<li>make tests for</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transmissions Topologies</h3>
<p><em>should I say &#39;posts&#39; or &#39;entries&#39;?</em></p>
<p>Control flow issues.</p>
<p>Postcraft application phases of operation:</p>
<ol>
<li>convert the markdown posts to raw HTML</li>
<li>convert the raw HTML of each post to a final page</li>
<li>convert the raw HTML of <em>some</em> posts into the index page</li>
</ol>
<p>It was cool how, during 1. the pipeline automagically forked at DirWalker, spawning a new instance for each post. I&#39;d like to keep that, and those processes can be continued into 2. But 3. really calls for starting back at a single path.</p>
