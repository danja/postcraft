<article class="post-content">
    <h1>This is not an Ecumenical Matter</h1>
<p>For context, I don&#39;t have much of a real-world social life compared my peers - I&#39;m borderline Boomer/Gen X. Those people that could do personal encounters, tendency to start dying nowadays. I&#39;m fine. In retrospect most of my motivation to engage with people, be a great party-goer, was driven by my genitals. That drive hasn&#39;t gone away, but desire for a quiet life has taken over.</p>
<p>Forget that. I have a besty, Marinella. Lives 5km away. Such a lovely person, I really landed on my feet meeting her.</p>
<p>Mari has a friend Sean staying for a couple of days. A guy she met in Rome years back. (I&#39;m terrible with datetime things. Fairly sure I&#39;m 60, Mari a decade older, Sean a decade older than that).</p>
<p>Sean is Irish, studied Missiology (the branch of theology to do with missions, comfortably named) in Rome, the epicentre of bonkers mythology.</p>
<p>Mari herself would be unusual anywhere, rural hills of Toscana, wtf. Like, when you meet her, it won&#39;t take long for you to realise that she&#39;s well-educated (was a gyn/obs surgeon), very clever. But her superpower is she&#39;s kind. After technically retiring, she went to (insert country) Africa to help out in a hospital.</p>
<p>I think she is brilliant herself. But she knows so many brilliant people. Is weird. (Although I do something similar myself - learn stuff, seek out the people who are best at things).</p>
<p>Back to Sean, her house guest for a couple of days. I didn&#39;t want to impinge, but I had to say hello at some point.</p>
<p>I&#39;m from a village in northern England. Prejudices. I did get to know plenty of Irish people in Sheffield (not true - Bernadette spoke for all Ireland, I think she was born in Sheffield), I <em>did</em> get to know plenty of Irish people in London.
But I still had the stereotype of an old Irish priest though.
Mostly Father Ted, bless his soul. Or Church ordained kiddy-fucker, not bless.</p>
<p>This Sean, worked as a priest <em>some</em> of his adult life. Lived in the Philipines for a while, then a lot of time in China - on paper teaching English (not a priest not a priest), helping Chinese postgrads to make their papers work in English.
Incredible guy. Absolute consumer of information - ok, that is a trait some people have, remember bus routes, but...
Maybe he would be diagnosed with autism or something if he saw a shrink, in his 80s. As we started chatting, talked about cars. Encyclopedic knowledge (I know absolutely nothing about cars). Travel things, Boieng engineering issues and how they&#39;d screwed up. We ended up on the geopolitical situation, at Mari&#39;s kitchen table. The guy is brilliant. Devours everything, which I&#39;ve seen plenty of humans do, but then he&#39;s analysed at a very careful level. I&#39;ve never seen such broadness brought together, totally consistently.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve left the best one until last, which happened first.</p>
<p>Literally the next thing he said after intros was that he wanted to sort out Mari&#39;s tired old computer (Yeah, I&#39;ve tried). He said &quot;I have 7 or 8 Linux distros on a stick here&quot;.
Yeah. That. Ancient Irish fecking priest.
Mint.</p>

    <h1>Know Your Place</h1>
<p>Two messages here, one for tech folks, one for everyone else.</p>
<p>Same message.</p>
<h2>Everyone</h2>
<p>The Web is a remarkable thing. Global communication in a way never before seen in the history. You can say things that can be read by not only friends and family, but by anyone on the planet. This is good, no? But the way your expression of <em>yourself</em> is currently being used is to sell whatever you say for advertising. The tech companies like Facebook etc... not in the business of making your life better, soley to make money.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, in the current situation it&#39;s fair enough. We get to express ourselves, they make dollars, fine. But this is really horrible when you stand back. We are the product, every word you type into Facebook is being sold to the highest bidder. Milk cows. Buy stuff.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help but be patronizing on this. You are acting like idiots. Giving away your most precious thing, your thoughts, for free to big companies to make money from.</p>
<p>I can call you an idiot because I do the same.
It isn&#39;t necessary. We can do better.
How? It is obvious in a way, but almost like secrets of an inner circle, poorly communicated. Shit handshakes.</p>
<h2>Tech People</h2>
<p>Right, you fuckers, start here.</p>
<p>There is no way you can take people off Twitter or Facebook. I use them both daily - tech bits/family. But it&#39;s not necessary to do much.</p>
<p>I think critical is a single point of origin. But that isn&#39;t easy. I&#39;ve been around this stuff a long time, it has just taken me <em>ages</em> to set up my blog again. (I still haven&#39;t put a feed there).
For most people that haven&#39;t the time to be banging their head against the wall with their own code, use an existing plantform.</p>
<p>Yeah, plant. Acorn, oak tree.</p>
<p>Something I wish to propose. It might well exist already, but I&#39;ve not seen it - shit evangelism.</p>
<p>An escape route.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>So one extreme, what I&#39;m doing here - typing shite on my desktop in <em>markdown</em> that will appear online under a domain name that&#39;s my identifier, I&#39;ve studied computers a long tme</li>
</ol>
<p>keep going here, to where 0 is posting on Facebook or Twitter, computers are an aid to my day-day, also pics of Auntie Mary</p>
<p>In between, like my brother blogs using Wordpress I think (could be MySpace), there&#39;s my place on a different system, but grounded in the idea of a canonical truth. I express this here. Here is a link to it. My words on Facebook are sugar, but if you want to read what I said -&gt; <a href="http://there">http://there</a>.</p>
<p>My techie friends, can we set up some place to help people get over these things?</p>
<p>There is a very fundamental need in people, I believe, for people to be protective about their things. Gestures of cognition are a projection of material things in evolutionary terms, dunno.
But I do believe that for globally society to function well, things have to work well at home.</p>
<p>A silly points system. How to get better...
Lets make a place to send people to.
Who&#39;s gonna name the domain?</p>

<p>Well, that was incredibly gruelling. But I&#39;ve now got a working static site generator, #Postcraft, and I&#39;m using it to generate this page. It&#39;s not pretty, but it&#39;s a start.</p>
<p>#Postcraft is only an <em>application</em> of something I&#39;m calling #Transmissions, a pipeliney thing to help me put together other (more interesting) systems. I&#39;ve spent ages on this thing, and raced the last mile to get this working end-to-end, leaving loads of dreadful hacky code in my wake. But it puts me in a good place from which to move forward. My immediate next step is just to sort out the TODOs in the codebase, so I can dip in to tidy up and know what I&#39;m doing. Meanwhile, I can start using it for some of that more interesting stuff, and blog about it!</p>

    <h1>Journal : 2024-05-16</h1>
<p>Yesterday, after lots of dreadful hackery, I <em>finally</em> got to a key milestone with #Postcraft static site builder (an application of #Transmissions). It&#39;s working end-to-end. There&#39;s still a massive amount of work to do on all levels, but it kind-of corresponds to a Minimum Viable Product (that only I will ever use). Enough is in place that I can actually start using it, it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.</p>
<p>Today, 5 priorities :</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the pages bare-minimum pretty to put online</li>
<li>Put online</li>
</ol>
<p>Stop. Two will do.</p>
<p>The page styling (CSS now, later little bits of JS etc) files should be declared in the manifest, but for now I&#39;ll just copy files over manually. Actually, why bother copying, might as well just point to the originals for now.</p>
<p>Oh FFS!!! It seems I changed something last night after it was all working, and now it&#39;s not. I&#39;ve done <code>git reset --hard</code>, nope. (Andwith that wiped some bits of tidying. Hey ho).</p>
<p>So I&#39;ll have to go back to the start of the pipeline, trace things step-by-step.
Which does actually give me what might be a good idea : the services do have a <em>signature</em>, very like those of function arguments/return value - what they expect to receive, what they pass on.
<em>Copilot in this (markdown) typing just suggested a &quot;contract&quot; for a service - I like that.</em>
So it should be straightforward to add some flagging, I guess in the common base class (in <code>Service.js</code>), in the first instance just for logging/debugging. But the same thing should lend itself to a natural interface for unit-ish testing.</p>

<p>Slow progress on #Postcraft.</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent a very long time trying to figure out why, although I had <code>s:Unfork</code> working in isolation, it wasn&#39;t working after <code>s:DirWalker</code>. I got it working, but haven&#39;t a clue what the problem was. Note to self : write more tests.</p>
<p>I just spent 2 hours trying to figure out why my RDF handling code wasn&#39;t working after a <code>switch(x){ case y: ... }</code>.
Foooolish Danny. I&#39;d forgotten to put <code>return</code> in the <code>case</code> blocks</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t getting the properties I needed in the context to render the front page. But now I believe I am.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;rootDir&quot;: &quot;/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name&quot;,

  &quot;siteURL&quot;: &quot;https://danny.ayers.name&quot;,
  &quot;subdir&quot;: &quot;blog&quot;,

  &quot;indexPage&quot;: {
    &quot;filepath&quot;: &quot;public/blog/index.html&quot;,
    &quot;templateFilename&quot;: &quot;layouts/mediocre/index-page_template.html&quot;
  },

  &quot;filepaths&quot;: [
    &quot;2024-05-03_one.md&quot;,
    &quot;2024-05-03_two.md&quot;
  ],
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, I&#39;m no longer concerned with the original markdown files, so before going any further I&#39;ll change <code>filepaths</code> to <code>slugs</code>. These will include the local subdirs leading to the slug proper, but no need to worry about that now.
Especially since I noticed that <code>s:DirWalker</code> isn&#39;t recursing properly.</p>
<p>Front page is rendering - <strong>Major milestone reached!!!</strong></p>
<p>TODO include milestone screen shot here</p>
<p>The code is <em>so</em> buggy &amp; hacky, and the current end result <em>so</em> ugly. But it&#39;s working end-to-end.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a massive amount of code tidying &amp; refactoring to do, but that&#39;s not one of the priorities right now. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the pages pretty enough to put online, and put online</li>
<li>Organise the TODOs so that I&#39;m clear what needs doing</li>
<li>Write the &#39;Hello (again) World!&#39; post</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve done enough prep for these that they shouldn&#39;t take too long.</p>
<p>Next I need to sort out my plans for #FOAF-Retrospective. I&#39;ll be needing #Transmissions &amp; #Postcraft in various places for that, so all this will still be getting attention.</p>
<p>I <strong>must avoid yak shaving</strong> but as I&#39;m sorting out all the TODOs, I should keep an eye on the project management project bigger picture.</p>
