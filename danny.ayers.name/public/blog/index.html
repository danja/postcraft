    <h1>Know Your Place</h1>
<p>Two messages here, one for tech folks, one for everyone else.</p>
<p>Same message.</p>
<h2>Everyone</h2>
<p>The Web is a remarkable thing. Global communication in a way never before seen in the history. You can say things that can be read by not only friends and family, but by anyone on the planet. This is good, no? But the way your expression of <em>yourself</em> is currently being used is to sell whatever you say for advertising. The tech companies like Facebook etc... not in the business of making your life better, soley to make money.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, in the current situation it&#39;s fair enough. We get to express ourselves, they make dollars, fine. But this is really horrible when you stand back. We are the product, every word you type into Facebook is being sold to the highest bidder. Milk cows. Buy stuff.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help but be patronizing on this. You are acting like idiots. Giving away your most precious thing, your thoughts, for free to big companies to make money from.</p>
<p>I can call you an idiot because I do the same.
It isn&#39;t necessary. We can do better.
How? It is obvious in a way, but almost like secrets of an inner circle, poorly communicated. Shit handshakes.</p>
<h2>Tech People</h2>
<p>Right, you fuckers, start here.</p>
<p>There is no way you can take people off Twitter or Facebook. I use them both daily - tech bits/family. But it&#39;s not necessary to do much.</p>
<p>I think critical is a single point of origin. But that isn&#39;t easy. I&#39;ve been around this stuff a long time, it has just taken me <em>ages</em> to set up my blog again. (I still haven&#39;t put a feed there).
For most people that haven&#39;t the time to be banging their head against the wall with their own code, use an existing plantform.</p>
<p>Yeah, plant. Acorn, oak tree.</p>
<p>Something I wish to propose. It might well exist already, but I&#39;ve not seen it - shit evangelism.</p>
<p>An escape route.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>So one extreme, what I&#39;m doing here - typing shite on my desktop in <em>markdown</em> that will appear online under a domain name that&#39;s my identifier, I&#39;ve studied computers a long tme</li>
</ol>
<p>keep going here, to where 0 is posting on Facebook or Twitter, computers are an aid to my day-day, also pics of Auntie Mary</p>
<p>In between, like my brother blogs using Wordpress I think (could be MySpace), there&#39;s my place on a different system, but grounded in the idea of a canonical truth. I express this here. Here is a link to it. My words on Facebook are sugar, but if you want to read what I said -&gt; <a href="http://there">http://there</a>.</p>
<p>My techie friends, can we set up some place to help people get over these things?</p>
<p>There is a very fundamental need in people, I believe, for people to be protective about their things. Gestures of cognition are a projection of material things in evolutionary terms, dunno.
But I do believe that for globally society to function well, things have to work well at home.</p>
<p>A silly points system. How to get better...
Lets make a place to send people to.
Who&#39;s gonna name the domain?</p>

<p>Well, that was incredibly gruelling. But I&#39;ve now got a working static site generator, #Postcraft, and I&#39;m using it to generate this page. It&#39;s not pretty, but it&#39;s a start.</p>
<p>#Postcraft is only an <em>application</em> of something I&#39;m calling #Transmissions, a pipeliney thing to help me put together other (more interesting) systems. I&#39;ve spent ages on this thing, and raced the last mile to get this working end-to-end, leaving loads of dreadful hacky code in my wake. But it puts me in a good place from which to move forward. My immediate next step is just to sort out the TODOs in the codebase, so I can dip in to tidy up and know what I&#39;m doing. Meanwhile, I can start using it for some of that more interesting stuff, and blog about it!</p>

<article class="post-content">
    <h1>Journal : 2024-05-16</h1>
<p>Yesterday, after lots of dreadful hackery, I <em>finally</em> got to a key milestone with #Postcraft static site builder (an application of #Transmissions). It&#39;s working end-to-end. There&#39;s still a massive amount of work to do on all levels, but it kind-of corresponds to a Minimum Viable Product (that only I will ever use). Enough is in place that I can actually start using it, it feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.</p>
<p>Today, 5 priorities :</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the pages bare-minimum pretty to put online</li>
<li>Put online</li>
</ol>
<p>Stop. Two will do.</p>
<p>The page styling (CSS now, later little bits of JS etc) files should be declared in the manifest, but for now I&#39;ll just copy files over manually. Actually, why bother copying, might as well just point to the originals for now.</p>
<p>Oh FFS!!! It seems I changed something last night after it was all working, and now it&#39;s not. I&#39;ve done <code>git reset --hard</code>, nope. (Andwith that wiped some bits of tidying. Hey ho).</p>
<p>So I&#39;ll have to go back to the start of the pipeline, trace things step-by-step.
Which does actually give me what might be a good idea : the services do have a <em>signature</em>, very like those of function arguments/return value - what they expect to receive, what they pass on.
<em>Copilot in this (markdown) typing just suggested a &quot;contract&quot; for a service - I like that.</em>
So it should be straightforward to add some flagging, I guess in the common base class (in <code>Service.js</code>), in the first instance just for logging/debugging. But the same thing should lend itself to a natural interface for unit-ish testing.</p>

<p>Slow progress on #Postcraft.</p>
<p>Yesterday I spent a very long time trying to figure out why, although I had <code>s:Unfork</code> working in isolation, it wasn&#39;t working after <code>s:DirWalker</code>. I got it working, but haven&#39;t a clue what the problem was. Note to self : write more tests.</p>
<p>I just spent 2 hours trying to figure out why my RDF handling code wasn&#39;t working after a <code>switch(x){ case y: ... }</code>.
Foooolish Danny. I&#39;d forgotten to put <code>return</code> in the <code>case</code> blocks</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t getting the properties I needed in the context to render the front page. But now I believe I am.</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;rootDir&quot;: &quot;/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name&quot;,

    &quot;2024-05-03_one.md&quot;,
    &quot;2024-05-03_two.md&quot;
  ],
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ok, I&#39;m no longer concerned with the original markdown files, so before going any further I&#39;ll change <code>filepaths</code> to <code>slugs</code>. These will include the local subdirs leading to the slug proper, but no need to worry about that now.
Especially since I noticed that <code>s:DirWalker</code> isn&#39;t recursing properly.</p>
<p>Front page is rendering - <strong>Major milestone reached!!!</strong></p>
<p>TODO include milestone screen shot here</p>
<p>The code is <em>so</em> buggy &amp; hacky, and the current end result <em>so</em> ugly. But it&#39;s working end-to-end.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a massive amount of code tidying &amp; refactoring to do, but that&#39;s not one of the priorities right now. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the pages pretty enough to put online, and put online</li>
<li>Organise the TODOs so that I&#39;m clear what needs doing</li>
<li>Write the &#39;Hello (again) World!&#39; post</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve done enough prep for these that they shouldn&#39;t take too long.</p>
<p>Next I need to sort out my plans for #FOAF-Retrospective. I&#39;ll be needing #Transmissions &amp; #Postcraft in various places for that, so all this will still be getting attention.</p>
<p>I <strong>must avoid yak shaving</strong> but as I&#39;m sorting out all the TODOs, I should keep an eye on the project management project bigger picture.</p>

    <h1>Journal : 2024-05-14</h1>
<p>This morning, post office then shopping with Mari. I did the minimum that seemed necessary on Bergi&#39;s &#39;Unified Landscape&#39; post, but when I pinged him he&#39;d told me he&#39;d already posted it. Not to worry, I&#39;m <em>very</em> encouraged that he&#39;s been looking at similar things to me.</p>
<p>Progress on #Postcraft! Last night I got the pipeline as far as rendering the individual entry HTML. I did get rather quick &amp; dirty with it, but that&#39;s fine for now. I&#39;ve already got a huge todo list, mostly refactorings that will be straightforward. Now I just want to keep the momentum up, get the whole thing working end-to-end, make it nice later.</p>
<p>TODO The how-to guide needs tips, <code>s:ShowMessage</code> etc</p>

<hr>
<p>That was a little annoying. I tried <code>s:Unfork</code> where it needed to go (after <code>s:DirWalker</code> etc) and it didn&#39;t work. After a <em>lot</em> of circular fiddling, it now works. I have no idea why it didn&#39;t before.</p>
<p>Ok, that <strong>Front Page</strong>.</p>
<p>How much to do in the pipeline, how much to hardcode in the template? (nunjucks is ok with that)</p>
<p>I could use another <code>s:DirWalker</code> to get the list of raw entry filenames, pass that to <code>s:Template</code> to render the front page. I might need to add a <code>s:Sort</code> service to get the entries in the right order (GitHub #Copilot suggested that, it&#39;s a good one).</p>
<p>Or... carry over what I&#39;ve already got/can get from the earlier <code>s:DirWalker</code>. That&#39;s probably the way to go.</p>
<p>Oops. It goes into an infinite loop when I add a subdir to the source dir. <code>s:DirWalker</code> needs a test, fix recursion. Leave that for now. What there is in the context after <code>s:Unfork</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;filepaths&quot;: [
    &quot;2024-05-03_one.md&quot;,
    &quot;2024-05-03_two.md&quot;
  ],
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm. It&#39;s a bit clunky, I&#39;ll have to remap those to the raw content HTML files. But it&#39;s not terrible, it can take the info from a single source, the bits of context derived from <code>manifest.ttl</code>.</p>

<p>#RELOCATE transmissions topology - multiple lists, series/parallel</p>
<p><a href="mailto:support-it@blackview.it">support-it@blackview.it</a></p>
<p>I believe I&#39;ve got <code>s:Unfork</code> working. I made a <code>s:Fork</code> to test it in isolation with a little test application. Fork/Unfork aren&#39;t very good names, something a like Multicast might be better. Leave that for the Great Refactoring, which I&#39;m do some time after #Postcraft is up and running.</p>
<p>It&#39;s funny, while I was trying to figure that out, the thought of providing something like a GOTO service crossed my mind. There is a natural progression from pipeline to flowchart-shaped structures, to a little language (with Turtle syntax!). But I have to invoke <strong>YAGNI</strong> here. It will be interesting to see what other steps in that direction I have to take, but the goal right now is to make it easy to get things done. And get them done.</p>
<p>Oops...I forgot I need to do generate the final entry pages next, before Unforking.</p>
<p>#RELOCATE pc:ContentGroup might be better as a more general trm:Group</p>
<h2>to add <code>s:Unfork</code> after the entry content generation phase, then</h2>
<p>Yesterday I said : Ok, for TODOs, I&#39;ll have a top-level <code>todo/index.md</code> file, plus monthly files like <code>todo/2024-05.md</code>. Then have <strong>Plan</strong> blocks in this journal for daily bits.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve got dangling, I&#39;m not sure how best to manage. It would be good to have a <em>Where I&#39;m At</em> <strong>Status</strong> somewhere. And a <strong>Requirements</strong>. And a convention for flagging doc chacteristics in terms of changeability.</p>
<p>Note to #RELOCATE, re. #GTD : I need to be clearer in demarcating my planning activity and the actual work. I&#39;m revising too much when I hit the code. I need clear plans <em>written down</em> before I start, no matter how long they take. Then code faster.</p>

<h4>Unfork</h4>
<p>Ok, the <strong>Topology</strong> question. Postcraft is quite a good example on which to be thinking about this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase One : Markdown -&gt; HTML at raw entry level, then raw entries -&gt; final entry pages</li>
<li>Phase Two : raw entries -&gt; front page etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase One forks into multiple processing paths, one for each markdown file. To avoid uneccessary complications, it makes sense to make sure Phase One has completed before starting Phase Two.
So,</p>
<p>I believe how I&#39;ve got <code>s:DirWalker</code> means that order is maintained subsequently, even though each path runs independently (parallelism for efficiency isn&#39;t something I need to think about now).</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>three semi-independent pipelines defined in transmission.ttl : markdown -&gt; HTML rawEntries; rawEntries -&gt; entries; rawEntries -&gt; front page</li>
<li>one &#39;continuous&#39;, with an Unfork or some such to bring the control flow down to one path</li>
<li>one more blocky, with ContentGroups being set up from manifest.ttl in ConfigMap at the start</li>
</ul>
<p>All three approaches could be supported, but for now I should just pick the one that seems most suitable for the current task. Considerations :</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping it simple, with sensible defaults</li>
<li>keeping concerns separate :<ul>
<li><code>transmission.ttl</code> = topology</li>
<li><code>services.ttl</code> = details of individual service configurations
together they define the application</li>
<li><code>manifest.ttl</code> = application instance configuration</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I need some fresh air.</p>
