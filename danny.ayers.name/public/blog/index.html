        Project Alignment
    </a>
</p>
<article class="post-content">
    <h1>Project Alignment</h1>
<p><em>I&#39;ve loads of notes broadly related to this, scattered around, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve written down this specific part yet. I&#39;ll expand later, but a placeholder in a place I can find again is a start.</em></p>
<p>My perma-meta-project I&#39;ve been working on for about 20 years started as an attempt at a personal knowledgebase, #PKB, but it soon morphed when it occurred to me that what I was after was really a project management system. There were reasons I wanted the PKB, clustered around <em>Getting Things Done</em>. I&#39;ve been through several iterations, and various factors (including LLMs) have led me start again recently.</p>
<p>I work alone most of the time, with lots of different things on the go. I&#39;m pretty bad at resisting interesting tangents, prone to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">Yak Shaving</a>, exceptionally good at procrastinating. So one thing I really want this system to do is tell me what I should do next.</p>
<p>Architecturally, an approach to implementation, I&#39;ve got a lot of that worked out. In short, express each project as a graph, with nodes representing tasks and edges representing dependencies. Weightings, like priorities and any time-related factors go in there too. Traverse the graph, with some lightweight reasoning, find the next task to do. I&#39;ve got a basic <a href="https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/project/2024/owldoc/">project ontology</a>, have got quite comfortable working against a SPARQL store for the data, with custom browser-based UI as needed.</p>
<p>Right now I&#39;ve got one project I&#39;m running very late to schedule with, working title &#39;FOAF Retrospective&#39;. But for to me to work anything like efficiently on <em>anything</em>, I need good information capture and organisation. Job One there is note-taking. I find a blogging kind of setup works well for me, and that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking at. Next on that list is capturing links, bookmarking. I&#39;ve got the code together (/in-progress), #Transmissions, to give me tooling to make the dev side of these kinds of things easier for me.</p>
<p>Now I can get to the aspect I&#39;m calling <strong>Project Alignment</strong>. While each of the FOAF, blogging, bookmarking projects can be considered independent, when decomposed into tasks, there is a huge amount of crossover. They have tasks in common. Their details might vary, but there&#39;s a functional requirement at the core of these that is near-enough. Put this way, these 3 projects are part of a larger dependency graph.</p>
<p>On the surface, despite an explosion in overall complexity in the dependency graph, the next-task question remains the same. In principle at least it&#39;s tractable with classic planner/reasoning algorithms. It is a &#39;simple&#39; special case, in that there is only one agent (me) at work, analogous to a single thread in running code.</p>
<p>But standing back, it seems pretty apparent that there should be extra optimisations to be had. If component X of system A and component Y of system B are reasonably similar, replacing X &amp; Y with a single component Z might be a win.</p>
<p>At this point in time I&#39;m doing this very ad hoc, but #Transmissions is designed explicitly with reusability of components in mind. I&#39;m hoping this will inform me of good ways to proceed. I can see LLMs being a big part of this in the near future.</p>
<p>But first things first, sketch out the general idea in black &amp; white. Done.</p>

        LDAP bits
    </a>
</p>
<article class="post-content">
    <h1>LDAP bits</h1>
<p>Main objective today is to put #LDAP authentication on a #Fuseki server.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve already got both running, apparently ok, on hyperdata.it</p>
<p><a href="https://directory.apache.org/studio/">Apache Directory Studio</a> seemed the obvious management client. Running locally, it looks like it&#39;s seeing the server fine.</p>
<p>Ok, I&#39;ll start at the LDAP end, I do need to refresh my memory on this stuff. Something simple in relative isolation before I think about Fuseki. A signup/login form.</p>
<p><em>Copilot autosuggested from my miskeying: Chtulu, I mean Fuseki, is running on port 3331. I&#39;ll try to get a simple LDAP client running on the same machine.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have an Ubuntu server with LDAP running. I also have nginx running on the same machine. I&#39;d like to make a simple sign-up login form, using nodejs on the server. I have Apache Directory Studio running locally for LDAP management.
Where do I start?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT gave me a reasonable-looking starting point.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve stuck it on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-node">https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-node</a>, locally :</p>
<p><code>~/HKMS/hyperdata-node</code></p>
<p>on server</p>
<p><code>root@hyperdata:/home/www/hyperdata.it# ln -s /home/github/hyperdata-node ./nodes</code></p>
<p>Oops, I&#39;ve already got a <code>~/HKMS/node-services</code>, has <code>.git</code>. Hey ho, merge them later.</p>
<p>I just remembered <a href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/">PM2</a> for managing nodejs services. Used it before, was straightforward.</p>

<article class="post-content">
    <h1>Today</h1>
<p>A bit of a distraction, my mother&#39;s unwell wants me to go over to hers. I&#39;ve said I&#39;ll see what I can do - provisionally about 5 days, some time this week.</p>
<p>Loose ends : static server bits, done, below.</p>
<p>Next, get some of the little <code>hyperdata</code> browser apps working again, against #Fuseki on this new server. I think all I need to do is set up the endpoints and maybe shove in a bit of starter data. I do need to get the auth working (I&#39;m planning on using LDAP), but that&#39;s not a priority right now.</p>
<h2>Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>reorg FOAF Retrospective <em>continues...</em></li>
<li>static server bits - I think that&#39;s mostly done for now</li>
<li>hyperdata browser apps against Fuseki</li>
<li>project alignment notes</li>
<li>blog layout tweaks</li>
<li>ADHD note</li>
</ul>
<h3>Static server bits</h3>
<p>It took me hours to realise why I had the static Web things set up on the old server the way they were, and why I was
struggling to get the missing bits joined in. Because they were all in separate git repositories. So obvious, but it just didn&#39;t click in my head. All I need to do is clone them on the new server, pop in a symlink, that should be it.</p>
<p>The login as regular user, su to root bit is a pain, I can&#39;t remember how to automate those bits - but AI can -</p>
<p>Locally :</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;danny.ayers@gmail.com&quot;
(I already had one)
ssh-copy-id danny@178.79.189.240
...
nano ~/.ssh/config

Host 178.79.189.240
    HostName hyperdata.it
    User danny
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    RequestTTY yes
    RemoteCommand sudo su -
</code></pre>
<p>Remote :</p>
<pre><code>sudo visudo
...add...
danny ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
</code></pre>
<p>Soo...the bits that were missing I <em>might</em> want to look at in the near future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>farelo</li>
<li>foolicious</li>
<li>foowiki</li>
<li>trellis</li>
<li>schema-editor</li>
<li>HKMS</li>
<li>trev</li>
<li>dork</li>
<li>environs</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(I haven&#39;t a clue what&#39;s in the last 4)</em></p>
<p>These were all under <code>/home/hkms-apps/</code> on the old server. I&#39;ve already created a <code>/home/github/</code> on the new server. Clunky naming, but I might as well use that for things above, symlink from <code>/home/hkms-apps</code> to <code>/home/github</code>.</p>
<p>Hmm. The tarball I got from the old server is lacking <code>.git</code> dirs in the above. I guess I must have stripped them out before zipping. No worries, I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;ll be the same as under <a href="https://github.com/danja">https://github.com/danja</a></p>
<p>Ok, cloned all those except for <strong>dork</strong>, apparently that&#39;s <em>Description of Runtime Klasses</em>. A Java thing I did ages ago, uses reflection to generate RDF descriptions of the code. I&#39;ll leave that one for now, I&#39;m not planning on doing any Java in the near future (no sure why it was on the server like this, hey ho).</p>
