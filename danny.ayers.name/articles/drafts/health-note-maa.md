ADHD

I have had a diagnosis of ADHD. It's a condition that is difficult to understand for anyone without it, and even for those with it, unless they do a bit of reading. Then, for them, it makes perfect sense. The public perception is way off the mark, and only recently has the medical profession remotely started getting their act together.

The effect on the individual is that they find certain things very difficult that most people find easy, and vice versa. It's not a lack of willpower or lack of effort (for the hard things) or being gifted (for the easy things). It's different wiring.

It's a condition that affects the way the brain processes information. The primary reference for psychiatrists, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), explicitly states that it is a disorder. It is recognised as a disability by law under certain circumstances (essentially if it impairs day-to-day life). I disagree strongly with the way it's framed, but that's the way it is.

I asked an AI to summarise the medical angle :

ADHD is a pathological condition with a neurological basis, characterized by differences in brain structure and function, particularly in areas related to attention and impulse control. It has a strong genetic component and is influenced by neurotransmitter dysregulation (especially dopamine and norepinephrine) and environmental factors such as prenatal exposures and toxins, leading to persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that impair daily functioning.

DSM-5 gives 2 categories : inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (with overlap between), but the way it shows itself are not the same for everyone.

From here on I'll be talking about my own particular kind.

All my life I have displayed characteristics that taken individually could be seen as just being a bit odd, stubborn and/or lazy. Taken together, there's a really distinctive pattern, consistent with ADHD.

This showed up when I did the WHO's self-assessment test, and I scored high. My psychiatrist gave me a really long assessment questionairre, again, I scored high. Observation of the the individual's behaviour is also a key part of the diagnosis - Marinella was able to supply this. If that wasn't enough, the way I responded to Ritalin was a clincher. It's a stimulant, related to speed (amphetamines). The effect in most people is what you'd expect. In people with ADHD, it paradoxically has a calming effect. That's what I got.

It's very common for people with ADHD to suffer from anxiety and depression as a result of difficulty in coping with every day life. Alcoholism and drug abuse are also common. I've had my share of all of these.

I do have a kind of internal hyperactivity, too much going on in my head that I'm no good at coordinating. This causes problems because I easily get overwhelmed.

Things I'm particularly bad at include admin, tidying up, and keeping track of things. I'm also bad at keeping to a schedule, making decisions, remembering things, being assertive. I'm not good at finishing things or being reliable. It also affects my relationships. I'm often not good at listening, I'm easily distracted. I'm not good at picking up on social cues. I'm not good at keeping in touch. I'm not good at being on time.

I really struggle with a lot of things that most people find easy. On the other hand - dunno, for example: If anything needs fixing, mechanical, electronic, software or whatever I can do it. If I don't know the tech details of something, I can usually figure it out no bother. Saying "but no-one wants to do that" or "everyone has those problems" is not helpful. It's like me saying "but everyone can write a 4th order low pass filter in C++ for an ARM Cortex-M4".

The best analogy I've come up with so far is like being an English visitor to Germany. You can get by, but you're always a bit out of your depth. You can't quite follow the conversation, you can't quite make yourself understood.
