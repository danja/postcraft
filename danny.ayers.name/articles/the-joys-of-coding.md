# The Joys of Coding

from chat with Mari

Most of the coding I do is around things I already know how to do in theory, it's just a (frustrating) process of expressing that in code

The thing of my own [Transmissions/Postcraft] (which overlaps with the work-work for danbri) has been very challenging at a conceptual level as well. In the big picture it's not exactly that original (I should be able to write one mediocre paper about it), but for me, very demanding on the brain

This video stuff [improving danbri's old foaf vid] is at a place where the coding isn't difficult in practice, minimal research has given me a plan, the complicated parts of code have already been done

There's a small amount of creativity involved in how to approach it, strategy

But best of all it's something that can be done step-by-step, lots of little satisfying little achievements
