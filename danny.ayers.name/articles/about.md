# Articles

I'll use **articles** to refer to material where there is (or will be) a clear theme, especially when there's a hint of longevity to the piece (even though the actual content will likely change over time). Tech procedures, opinion pieces and the like. This is in contrast to **entries**, which are likely to mix material and be less structured - more about the moment. Daily journal, quick notes etc.
