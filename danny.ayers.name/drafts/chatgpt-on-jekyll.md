In Jekyll and many static site generators, the folder structure is designed to organize content, templates, static files, and configuration settings efficiently. While specifics can vary slightly from one generator to another, they generally follow a similar organizational pattern. Here's a breakdown of the typical folder structure in Jekyll, which is a popular Ruby-based static site generator:

1. **`_posts/`**: This directory contains the blog posts, usually written in Markdown or HTML. Posts are typically organized by date in their filenames (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`).

2. **`_drafts/`**: Drafts are unpublished posts without a date in their filenames. Jekyll does not build files in this folder unless specifically instructed to include drafts in the build process.

3. **`_layouts/`**: Contains templates that wrap around your content. These templates define common site structures, such as headers, footers, and navigation bars.

4. **`_includes/`**: This folder is for partials that can be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts. It's useful for reusable components like a page header, a footer, or navigation menus.

5. **`_data/`**: Stores data files in formats like YAML, JSON, or CSV, which can be accessed via the site's content. This is useful for managing data that's used across the site, such as configuration parameters or a list of team members.

6. **`_site/`**: This is where the generated site will be output by default when Jekyll builds the site. It's the final product that you'll deploy to your hosting provider.

7. **`_assets/`**: Though not a default folder in Jekyll, it's a common convention to use an `assets/` directory for storing static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. Jekyll plugins like `jekyll-assets` can help manage these assets.

8. **`.config.yml`**: The main configuration file for Jekyll. It's used to set global configurations and variables for the site (e.g., the site title, description, URL, and many more settings).

9. **`Gemfile`**: If you're using Bundler with Jekyll, the `Gemfile` specifies the gem dependencies for your site. This is where you would list Jekyll itself, along with any plugins and themes you're using.

10. **`index.html` or `index.md`**: The main homepage for your site, typically located at the root of the directory. It can use layout templates and include content from other files.

Other static site generators will have a similar structure but may name directories differently or use additional folders specific to their features or templating languages. The key idea across these tools is the separation of content from layout, enabling the dynamic generation of static HTML files from templates and markdown or data files.
