## AI Support

The other day I had a play with [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/), which is a chatbot frontend that can be connected to a range of AI services. I got it running on my local machine, have done a `git pull` and have been adding services.

[notes from the other day]()

From [Known Endpoints](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/ai_endpoints) in `librechat.example.yaml` :

- [AnyScale](https://anyscale.com/)
- [API Pie](https://apipie.ai/)
- [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/)
- [GROQ](https://groq.ai/)
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
- [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/)
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
- [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) - requires payment first
- [Shuttle AI](https://shuttleai.app/)
- [Together AI](https://api.together.ai/)

I've added API keys for those to my `.env`. (Don't forget to include it in the `.gitignore` before committing!)

Listed in the [endpoints](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/ai_endpoints) but weren't in the sample `.env`, I've also added:

- [Cohere](https://cohere.com)
- [DataBricks](https://databricks.com) - wasn't obvious where to get the API key, left for now

_to be continued..._

It also supports RAG, and somewhere it mentions using HuggingFace for embeddings. So also in my `.env`:

```
RAG_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=huggingface
HF_TOKEN=...
```

```
danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LibreChat$ docker compose ls
danny@danny-desktop:~/AI/LibreChat$ docker compose up -d
```

Hmm. It doesn't appear to be picking up the new `.env` settings, even after `docker compose `. Try again later.

## Tidy up Postcraft

The [Transmissions](https://github.com/danja/transmissions) refactoring might take a while, and will no doubt break the setup for [Postcraft](https://github.com/danja/postcraft) in the interim. So I'll do a quick tidy up there first, publish the current material.

ok, `2024-04-27_postcraft-flow.md` says:

```
./run postcraft /home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/danny.ayers.name
```

I guess that'll be from `danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/transmissions$` - the terminal I have in #Cursor.

Ok, that appears to have run ok. I'll push those changes, then do a quick check of the
