# Hello (again) World!

_actually **Journal : 2024-05-18** but as this will be the first visible post, that title will do_

Well, that was incredibly gruelling. But I've now got a working static site generator, #Postcraft, and I'm using it to generate this page. It's not pretty, but it's a start.

#Postcraft is only an _application_ of something I'm calling #Transmissions, a pipeliney thing to help me put together other (more interesting) systems. I've spent ages on this thing, and raced the last mile to get this working end-to-end, leaving loads of dreadful hacky code in my wake. But it puts me in a good place from which to move forward. My immediate next step is just to sort out the TODOs in the codebase, so I can dip in to tidy up and know what I'm doing. Meanwhile, I can start using it for some of that more interesting stuff, and blog about it!
