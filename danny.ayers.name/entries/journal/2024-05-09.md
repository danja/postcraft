# Journal : 2024-05-09

Ok, I need to figure a system for the sketchy daily todos. They so often carry over... Maybe monthly files?

Also, now I want to look at topologies in Transmissions using Postcraft as the example, where to put those notes?

I guess defaulting to the journal is a good idea. Later move any conclusions to the appropriate project-specific location.

- make tests for

### Transmissions Topologies

_should I say 'posts' or 'entries'?_

Control flow issues.

Postcraft application phases of operation:

1. convert the markdown posts to raw HTML
2. convert the raw HTML of each post to a final page
3. convert the raw HTML of _some_ posts into the index page

It was cool how, during 1. the pipeline automagically forked at DirWalker, spawning a new instance for each post. I'd like to keep that, and those processes can be continued into 2. But 3. really calls for starting back at a single path.
