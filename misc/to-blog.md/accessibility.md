It's no secret I'm a mediocre coder with a terrible memory and slow thinking. I often have to switch language, with the result that I'm never current with any. I also use recording tools etc, often get UIs mixed up. These are trivial compared to what's usually considered 'special needs', but definitely cognitive disabilities (I've been around long enough to have picked up workarounds to compensate). Already ChatGPT is massively helpful.
